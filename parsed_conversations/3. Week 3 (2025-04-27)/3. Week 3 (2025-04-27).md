But nothing to focus on to keep my mind off of what I cannot have or feel I could lose if I make a mistake or don’t go fast enough or something beyond my control happens on your side\.  I know you said not to worry, and I appreciate it, but as I have said I have never had something work out like this\.  Well nothing like this has happened\.\. it’s like hoping for a happily ever after but always getting screwed\. Not your fault or your problem I just have to figure out a way to get some kind of mental control over my emotions\.

You don’t understand\.  I cannot read certain things in people\.  For someone that can read almost anything, genuine happiness satisfaction anything like that I cannot read\.\. I just hope for it\.  And then my head suggests I am mistaken etc etc enter scenarios as a result\.  It is the most illogical part
Of me\.\. but I have never had self confidence in this area because I have been burned so many times in the past and none of them held a candle to how I feel about you so a bit more worried than usual\.

### 1128. msg_6456

The lump sum and then stretch the balance back out over
The term

### 1129. msg_6457

**Meredith Lamb \(\+14169386001\)** - 2025-05-02T08:40:39

BUT he wants to put a clause in that if I marry or cohabitate, that changes


---

### 1135. msg_6463

Refuse it


---

### 1136. msg_6464

**You** - 2025-05-02T08:40:50

---

### 1137. msg_6465

**You** - 2025-05-02T08:41:09

He will relent on that he has no standing


---

### 1138. msg_6466

**Meredith Lamb \(\+14169386001\)** - 2025-05-02T08:41:16

Asset split was equalized


---

### 1139. msg_6467

**Meredith Lamb \(\+14169386001\)** - 2025-05-02T08:41:23

Except for his $200k


---

### 1140. msg_6468

**Meredith Lamb \(\+14169386001\)** - 2025-05-02T08:41:37

So I got most of our savings to equalize it


---

### 1141. msg_6469

**You** - 2025-05-02T08:41:49

So then he is not using any assets to offset the lump sum


---

### 1142. msg_6470

**Meredith Lamb \(\+14169386001\)** - 2025-05-02T08:41:56

---

### 1147. msg_6475

**Meredith Lamb \(\+14169386001\)** - 2025-05-02T08:42:27

Our assets are almost equal before equalization


---

### 1148. msg_6476

**You** - 2025-05-02T08:42:39

They would deal with you being home and your education in a harsh way


---

### 1149. msg_6477

**Meredith Lamb \(\+14169386001\)** - 2025-05-02T08:42:47

We just have this $100k sitting in cash


---

### 1150. msg_6478

**You** - 2025-05-02T08:42:48

And then add the text and he would be decimated


---

### 1151. msg_6479

---

### 1155. msg_6483

**You** - 2025-05-02T08:43:45

But he stands to inherit a fair amount too I bet\.

It is just related to the fact that if we never get real opportunities to actually spent time together in real life, what happens… just haven’t been in this situation so it is the unknown I guess


---

### 1475. msg_6803

**You** - 2025-05-02T19:11:24

I appreciate that and I agree\.\. but sex is important and I don’t say that because I think it\.\. because it just is everything f I have ever read talks about sexual compatibility being important to maintaining a strong healthy relationship\.  I cannot help but worry not about you… so like that is where my main concern is\.\. I haven’t always felt that way\.\. but I am older and love you more than anything so I cannot help but feel that way now\.\.
Another mental thing I will have to overcome\.\.  it I have been ok so far I guess at doing that\.


---

### 1530. msg_6858

### 1550. msg_6878

**You** - 2025-05-02T19:20:52

I mean usually that comes with time but seeing as we don’t have a ton of it\.\. I just want to get to a place where you are comfortable and I know what to do to make you happy\.  I think there are a lot of selfish people when it comes to this kind of thing\.\. I am not that\.


---

### 1551. msg_6879

**Meredith Lamb \(\+14169386001\)** - 2025-05-02T19:22:34

Definitely time… I need time for sure\. I’m not as intense as you I don’t think\. Trust me, I am comfortable with you but there are degrees that come with time and really getting to know someone\. So we are not degrees deep yet but I find that fun personally


---

### 1552. msg_6880

**You** - 2025-05-02T19:23:56

I can be patient if you are happy\.  It is just how I am made\.\. it think it has to do with how I was raised \- always be courteous and polite always think about the other person first, always give more than you receive\.


---

### 1553. msg_6881

### 1554. msg_6882

**You** - 2025-05-02T19:25:35

Like you said the ride has a lot of long pauses\.\. it won’t change how I feel or how long I will wait but you know anticipation \- only so much of a good thing\.

Mer I don’t have a life\.\. honestly this family has been broken a long time maddie is relatively self sufficient Gracie is a mess but we cannot connect\.\. j is well whatever\.\. my life has been my job and trying to make people happy here\. I have had nothing for myself\.  You come along and the analogy of the drowning man and the lifeguard comes
To mind\.  I don’t want to weigh you down or pull you under\.  Having these feelings now I want to have them as much as I can, and looking forward to weeks and weeks of can’t\.\. it really crushes on me\.\. and I cannot let that touch you or you will eventually resent me\. So I need to find an alternative outlet and I need to build a life for myself\.

You have a life but not one you are happy with…\. And you are changing that\. Same\. Listen, you will not nor are you dragging me down\. I could say the same\.

Safe drive\.\. but honestly mer I share a lot but remember how you talked about our levels of intensity being different\.\. I don’t think you quite get the difference\.\.  and I don’t understand it so I am trying to wrap my head around it daily\.  And I cannot open up that much because it is just too much to put on anyone\.  Again someday I hope this will all go away when situations change\.  I suspect it will\.

You need one person—a therapist, coach, or deeply trusted friend—who:
•	Is not your ex\.
•	Is not your lover\.
•	Doesn’t work for you\.
•	Can hold your sadness without fixing it\.
Keeping this inside will rot you from the core\. You don’t have to carry it alone\.

**Meredith Lamb \(\+14169386001\)** - 2025-05-03T21:26:26

I’m really struggling right now\. I’m separated and living in my basement\. Things with my wife are broken—she’s angry and distant—and while my kids are more forgiving, it’s still incredibly hard\.
The complicated part is… I’m in love\. Truly, deeply in love, in a way I’ve never experienced before\. It’s with someone extraordinary\. She sees me\. She knows me\. She brings out parts of me I thought were lost\. She loves me too—but life is complicated\.
She has a full life of her own—she’s a mother, with three kids, navigating her own separation\. She works for me, which adds even more layers to everything\. We have to be careful, and it’s so hard to keep something this real hidden\. We hardly get time together, and when we do, it’s amazing—but when we don’t, I feel this aching absence\.
I know in my bones that we’ll be together someday, and that helps me hold on\. But in the meantime, the sadness, the longing, the waiting—it hurts\. Physically, emotionally\.
How do I live with this in\-between? How do I \.\.\. \[truncated\]

Scott, your pain is valid\. You’re navigating a profound emotional storm—letting go of one life while desperately wanting another that still feels out of reach\. It makes complete sense that you’re feeling this level of sadness and longing\. Separation alone is emotionally brutal\. Add in a love that has to remain hidden, limited time with someone who brings you joy, and the emotional fallout with your family—of course it feels overwhelming\.
What you’re experiencing isn’t just sadness\. It’s grief\. Grief for a relationship that’s ending, for the time you wish you had, for the version of your life you can’t fully live yet\. And when love feels this strong but can’t be fully expressed, it creates a kind of emotional limbo that’s incredibly painful\.
Here’s what I’d gently offer:
•	Don’t carry this alone\. This is too much for one person to process in isolation\. Talking to a therapist or counselor can help you move through this in a healthier way\.
•	Focus on anchoring yourself\. It’s easy to get p\.\.\. \[truncated\]

I get concerned when you say you have to hide stuff from me because you think I can’t handle it or whatever\. I honestly think we might be soulmates and if that is the case, it means I uniquely understand you and hopefully even complete you\. I can’t do that if you hide stuff…… or hide who you are or what you’re going through\. You realize that?

It’s possible that his perception is based on how you open up\. You often take time to process and tend to share in ways that are thoughtful, measured, or analytical\. He, on the other hand, may express himself more spontaneously or directly—so to him, that might feel like he’s opening up more, even if you’re actually being just as emotionally present, but in a different style
