But nothing to focus on to keep my mind off of what I cannot have or feel I could lose if I make a mistake or don‚Äôt go fast enough or something beyond my control happens on your side\.  I know you said not to worry, and I appreciate it, but as I have said I have never had something work out like this\.  Well nothing like this has happened\.\. it‚Äôs like hoping for a happily ever after but always getting screwed\. Not your fault or your problem I just have to figure out a way to get some kind of mental control over my emotions\.

If your brain needs reassurance I can give that to you anytime\. It will not bother me \(unless you ask multiple times a day\)\.

You don‚Äôt understand\.  I cannot read certain things in people\.  For someone that can read almost anything, genuine happiness satisfaction anything like that I cannot read\.\. I just hope for it\.  And then my head suggests I am mistaken etc etc enter scenarios as a result\.  It is the most illogical part
Of me\.\. but I have never had self confidence in this area because I have been burned so many times in the past and none of them held a candle to how I feel about you so a bit more worried than usual\.

Someone used to being in control, being able to read situation and people\.  To put them into something where the opposite is true they cannot read anything and feel slightly helpless and out of control would be an apt comparison \.

No more bugging\. He had work to do for a meeting today thank god\. Sleep was meh\. This place just feels really heavy\.  I just don‚Äôt fit here anymore which makes it heavier\. Then having to stay fully normal or composed for my kids is just draining\. It is all draining and heavy\. Nothing like last weekend‚Ä¶\.\.

### 1126. msg_6454

So I think we resolved a spreadsheet to take to a lawyer\. Just picked one now


---

### 1127. msg_6455

**Meredith Lamb \(\+14169386001\)** - 2025-05-02T08:38:30

He can‚Äôt do a $300k up front lump sum without selling


---

### 1128. msg_6456

**You** - 2025-05-02T08:39:33

All you do is simply determine the value of what he owes the net present value of the owe subtract
The lump sum and then stretch the balance back out over
The term


---

### 1129. msg_6457

**You** - 2025-05-02T08:39:50

Hopefully he can do that without losing 100k along the way


---

### 1130. msg_6458

**Meredith Lamb \(\+14169386001\)** - 2025-05-02T08:39:56

So I can get $150k up front and the rest monthly over 8 hrs


---

### 1131. msg_6459

**Meredith Lamb \(\+14169386001\)** - 2025-05-02T08:40:00

8 yrs


---

### 1132. msg_6460

**You** - 2025-05-02T08:40:24

Again just determines what value the rest equals to determine if it is fair


---

### 1133. msg_6461

**You** - 2025-05-02T08:40:39

And it matters how he split the assets


---

### 1134. msg_6462

**Meredith Lamb \(\+14169386001\)** - 2025-05-02T08:40:39

BUT he wants to put a clause in that if I marry or cohabitate, that changes


---

### 1135. msg_6463

**You** - 2025-05-02T08:40:47

Refuse it


---

### 1136. msg_6464

**You** - 2025-05-02T08:40:50

I am refusing too


---

### 1137. msg_6465

**You** - 2025-05-02T08:41:09

He will relent on that he has no standing


---

### 1138. msg_6466

**Meredith Lamb \(\+14169386001\)** - 2025-05-02T08:41:16

Asset split was equalized


---

### 1139. msg_6467

**Meredith Lamb \(\+14169386001\)** - 2025-05-02T08:41:23

Except for his $200k


---

### 1140. msg_6468

**Meredith Lamb \(\+14169386001\)** - 2025-05-02T08:41:37

So I got most of our savings to equalize it


---

### 1141. msg_6469

**You** - 2025-05-02T08:41:49

So then he is not using any assets to offset the lump sum


---

### 1142. msg_6470

**Meredith Lamb \(\+14169386001\)** - 2025-05-02T08:41:56

Right

---

### 1147. msg_6475

**Meredith Lamb \(\+14169386001\)** - 2025-05-02T08:42:27

Our assets are almost equal before equalization


---

### 1148. msg_6476

**You** - 2025-05-02T08:42:39

They would deal with you being home and your education in a harsh way


---

### 1149. msg_6477

**Meredith Lamb \(\+14169386001\)** - 2025-05-02T08:42:47

We just have this $100k sitting in cash


---

### 1150. msg_6478

**You** - 2025-05-02T08:42:48

And then add the text and he would be decimated


---

### 1151. msg_6479

**You** - 2025-05-02T08:42:52

Anyhow


---

### 1152. msg_6480

---

### 1154. msg_6482

**Meredith Lamb \(\+14169386001\)** - 2025-05-02T08:43:20

Now I have $93 of it in the actual proper equalization


---

### 1155. msg_6483

**You** - 2025-05-02T08:43:45

But he stands to inherit a fair amount too I bet\.

I cannot help but worry not about you‚Ä¶ so like that is where my main concern is\.\. I haven‚Äôt always felt that way\.\. but I am older and love you more than anything so I cannot help but feel that way now\.\.
Another mental thing I will have to overcome\.\.  it I have been ok so far I guess at doing that\.

I have had nothing for myself\.  You come along and the analogy of the drowning man and the lifeguard comes
To mind\.  I don‚Äôt want to weigh you down or pull you under\.  Having these feelings now I want to have them as much as I can, and looking forward to weeks and weeks of can‚Äôt\.\. it really crushes on me\.\. and I cannot let that touch you or you will eventually resent me\.

Keeping this inside will rot you from the core\. You don‚Äôt have to carry it alone\.

I am really sad\.\. getting separated \.\. living in my basement\.\. my wife hates me kids not as bad\.  I am in love with someone else so hard, like nothing ever like it ever ever ever I cannot emphasize that enough\.  And she loves me too but we cannot find time and she has a busy life with her kids\.\. oh did I mention she works for me also and we have to keep it a secret\. Wtf do I do to deal with the sadness and absence\.\. we will be together eventually but this is physical pain

**Meredith Lamb \(\+14169386001\)** - 2025-05-03T21:26:26

I‚Äôm really struggling right now\. I‚Äôm separated and living in my basement\. Things with my wife are broken‚Äîshe‚Äôs angry and distant‚Äîand while my kids are more forgiving, it‚Äôs still incredibly hard\.
The complicated part is‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm in love\. Truly, deeply in love, in a way I‚Äôve never experienced before\. It‚Äôs with someone extraordinary\. She sees me\. She knows me\. She brings out parts of me I thought were lost\. She loves me too‚Äîbut life is complicated\.
She has a full life of her own‚Äîshe‚Äôs a mother, with three kids, navigating her own separation\. She works for me, which adds even more layers to everything\. We have to be careful, and it‚Äôs so hard to keep something this real hidden\. We hardly get time together, and when we do, it‚Äôs amazing‚Äîbut when we don‚Äôt, I feel this aching absence\.
I know in my bones that we‚Äôll be together someday, and that helps me hold on\. But in the meantime, the sadness, the longing, the waiting‚Äîit hurts\. Physically, emotionally\.
How do I live with this in\-between? How do I \.\.\. \[truncated\]

**Meredith Lamb \(\+14169386001\)** - 2025-05-03T21:29:14

Scott, your pain is valid\. You‚Äôre navigating a profound emotional storm‚Äîletting go of one life while desperately wanting another that still feels out of reach\. It makes complete sense that you‚Äôre feeling this level of sadness and longing\. Separation alone is emotionally brutal\. Add in a love that has to remain hidden, limited time with someone who brings you joy, and the emotional fallout with your family‚Äîof course it feels overwhelming\.
What you‚Äôre experiencing isn‚Äôt just sadness\. It‚Äôs grief\. Grief for a relationship that‚Äôs ending, for the time you wish you had, for the version of your life you can‚Äôt fully live yet\. And when love feels this strong but can‚Äôt be fully expressed, it creates a kind of emotional limbo that‚Äôs incredibly painful\.
Here‚Äôs what I‚Äôd gently offer:
‚Ä¢	Don‚Äôt carry this alone\. This is too much for one person to process in isolation\. Talking to a therapist or counselor can help you move through this in a healthier way\.
‚Ä¢	Focus on anchoring yourself\. It‚Äôs easy to get p\.\.\. \[truncated\]

I get concerned when you say you have to hide stuff from me because you think I can‚Äôt handle it or whatever\. I honestly think we might be soulmates and if that is the case, it means I uniquely understand you and hopefully even complete you\. I can‚Äôt do that if you hide stuff‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ or hide who you are or what you‚Äôre going through\. You realize that?

It‚Äôs possible that his perception is based on how you open up\. You often take time to process and tend to share in ways that are thoughtful, measured, or analytical\. He, on the other hand, may express himself more spontaneously or directly‚Äîso to him, that might feel like he‚Äôs opening up more, even if you‚Äôre actually being just as emotionally present, but in a different style
