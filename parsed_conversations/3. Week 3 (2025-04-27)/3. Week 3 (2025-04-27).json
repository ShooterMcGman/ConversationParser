Things with my wife are broken—she’s angry and distant—and while my kids are more forgiving, it’s still incredibly hard.\nThe complicated part is… I’m in love. Truly, deeply in love, in a way I’ve never experienced before. It’s with someone extraordinary. She sees me. She knows me. She brings out parts of me I thought were lost. She loves me too—but life is complicated.\nShe has a full life of her own—she’s a mother, with three kids, navigating her own separation. She works for me, which adds even more layers to everything. We have to be careful, and it’s so hard to keep something this real hidden. We hardly get time together, and when we do, it’s amazing—but when we don’t, I feel this aching absence.\nI know in my bones that we’ll be together someday, and that helps me hold on. But in the meantime, the sadness, the longing, the waiting—it hurts. Physically, emotionally.\nHow do I live with this in-between? How do I cope with missing someone I love so deeply when being with her fully just isn’t possible yet?”**\n⸻\nWould you like a version that sounds more like a text to a close friend, or something for a journal or therapist?",

   "content":"Scott, your pain is valid. You’re navigating a profound emotional storm—letting go of one life while desperately wanting another that still feels out of reach. It makes complete sense that you’re feeling this level of sadness and longing. Separation alone is emotionally brutal. Add in a love that has to remain hidden, limited time with someone who brings you joy, and the emotional fallout with your family—of course it feels overwhelming.\nWhat you’re experiencing isn’t just sadness. It’s grief. Grief for a relationship that’s ending, for the time you wish you had, for the version of your life you can’t fully live yet. And when love feels this strong but can’t be fully expressed, it creates a kind of emotional limbo that’s incredibly painful.\nHere’s what I’d gently offer:\n•\tDon’t carry this alone. This is too much for one person to process in isolation. Talking to a therapist or counselor can help you move through this in a healthier way.\n•\tFocus on anchoring yourself. It’s easy to get pulled into the dream of the future, but your body and mind still need you here, now. Even small routines, movement, or creative expression can ground you.\n•\tBe kind to yourself. You’re not a villain for loving someone new, or for being heartbroken over your past. You’re human. Complex, emotional, and worthy of grace.\nYou don’t have to have all the answers today. But if you can find a way to stay present—even just a little—you’ll give yourself space to eventually arrive at the life you want to live. One day at a time.”**",
