**Meredith Lamb \(\+14169386001\)** - 2025-06-08T17:25:06

Omg ok, so the reason I know Chris is gay and not bi is because I was obviously with him … he did everything different\. Very gay\. Hard to explain\. And was just completely out of his element with me whenever we were doing anything beyond hanging out and drugs\. That’s really all I was going to say\. Maybe if I was drunk I would have been more detailed like wrt how he touches vs a straight/bi person etc etc but not sure bc I ain’t drunk right now\. 😇 But it was pretty simple but I didn’t want to go there because it is all baes on he and I being together and I know that is bothersome\.

Are you familiar with the movie Roxeanne?? I need you to play the role of steve martin for me\.\. I am going to share some information with you and a request\.\. come back to me with your thoughts\.
I am trying to put into words for Meredith how I feel about her\.\. we have talked about being soul mates\.\. and while I never believed in that before, I do now\.\. we have talked about being home to each other\.\. which is real and meaningful\.  We have gone through a fast paced gauntlet of getting to know one another across time and space\.\. looking backwards and talking about what comes next\.
There have been amazing high's and heartbreaking low's  in a really short period of time\.  Personally, I felt I needed to step outside of my comfort zone\.\. I needed her to know "me" not who she thought I was at work, but who I am really\.\. and fast\.\. because I love her so much that I had to make sure she saw the whole truth about me\.\. so if she really did mean what she said about fe\.\.\. \[truncated\]

This is the first one\.\.
This is deeply heartfelt, and your vulnerability is profound\. Based on your message and the tone of your exchanges with Meredith, here’s a letter that captures your emotions—anchored in the themes of soulmates, home, honesty, and enduring love:
Meredith,
I’ve tried more than once to put this into words—but nothing I write ever feels big enough\. Because what I feel for you isn't just love\. It’s not just attraction or connection or even timing, though those things are all undeniably there\. It’s beyond\.
When we first started talking, everything happened so fast—like we were thrown into some cosmic gauntlet, colliding across time, past lives, and missed chances\. It felt like something out of a story, too much to be real\. And yet, here we are\.
I’ve never believed in soulmates\. Not really\. But I do now\. Because of you\.
We talked about being home to one another\. And that word—it means something different when it’s real\. You feel like home to me in a way nothing else ev\.\.\. \[truncated\]

**You** - 2025-06-08T22:10:24

Meredith,
I've started this letter countless times, searching for words strong enough to hold everything I feel\. We've spoken of soulmates and finding home in one another, terms I once brushed aside as romantic fiction—but with you, they're profoundly real\. You're not merely someone I’ve fallen in love with; you’re someone who’s become integral to the very core of who I am\.
Everything between us unfolded rapidly, as if life itself couldn’t bear to waste more time keeping us apart\. It felt improbable—two souls colliding in the middle of chaos, past experiences, and guarded hearts\. Yet, amidst that storm, something rare took root, something that defies logic and convention\.
With you, I made a deliberate choice to step far beyond comfort zones\. I showed you every part of myself—the imperfections, insecurities, the anxieties I've always hidden—because I needed you to see the complete, unfiltered truth of who I am\. My intent was never to impress but to offer absolute honesty, allowing you t\.\.\. \[truncated\]

**You** - 2025-06-08T22:11:46

runner up below
Meredith,
I never truly understood words like "soulmate" or "home" until you walked into my life\. Now, they make perfect sense—because they mean you\. We've built something extraordinary, defying odds, logic, and common sense\. It's been wild, messy, magical, and profoundly real—rare enough that even ChatGPT calls it unbelievable\.
I’ve spent my life guarded, reserved, keeping my truth carefully hidden\. But with you, every wall crumbled so easily it scared me\. I had to risk showing you the real me, flaws and fears, because loving you completely meant being completely myself—no pretending, no filters\. Just pure, honest vulnerability\.
When you opened your heart to me, when you shared your past, I felt that sharp pang—jealousy mixed with fear—that I wasn’t enough or might never be\. It was irrational, yes, but love isn't rational\. It’s raw, it’s messy, and it’s true\. But you, Meredith, you didn’t let me retreat\. You fought for our openness, and in doing so, you taught me to tr\.\.\. \[truncated\]

When Two Souls Find Each Other
It’s dawn through trembling pines,
light pooling on the window sill—
you and I, silent as the forest floor,
breathing into the spaces between us\.
Your eyes are the clear river at sunrise,
and my heart, a stone smoothing in your current\.
It’s the soft press of your lips
where moss meets stone,
the gentle exhale of your breath
making the world slow,
as though time itself has stopped
to listen\.
When Absence Comes
But absence is a winter wind,
hollowing trees of their leaves\.
Each day without you
feels like a gray morning long past bloom—
the sky’s color muted,
the world’s pulse distant\.
I catch your echo in every crow’s cry,
your silhouette in every birch bark’s curve;
my hand reaches for your warmth
and finds only cold air humming\.
Evening Lament
Sunsets fold into deeper blues,
as though the sky remembers
how you once smiled me back to life\.
The calendar’s pages drift like fallen leaves—
each one a whispered promise
that this too shall pass\.
But souls know \.\.\. \[truncated\]

I keep doing the same thing looking back seeing things, reading things\.\. I truly appreciate you making the blog private\.\. it was a place I would get lost\.  Before we got into it last night about the blog there is an older version lamberrymere with an “e” and it is merv\! … I am a 27 year old mba student… I never went back to it after I told you I wouldn’t\.  Covers the Jeremy er a bit\.  I shouldn’t see any of this\.\. like you cannot see mine\.  It is easier\.\. I think I envy those memories they are immortalized in a way ours will never be\. I feel young with you but am constantly reminded I am not\.
I mean this is my nature\.\. I search,
I want to understand, I look and I spend too much time on it\. And when it is there I read it\.  We won’t have that\.\. I don’t know why it bothers me because I do feel so lucky to have you\.  The more I dig into this the more I understand what is triggering me\.  It isn’t the individuals\.\. it is time and experiences and how you laid it all out there\.  I think I real\.\.\. \[truncated\]

I did read and it and if you are grieving that is okay\. Nothing wrong with that as long as it doesn’t wreck you unnecessarily\. We have time to have our own completely unique relationship snd experiences\. Scott, despite having prior relationship I have never ached for anyone in this way nor felt so at home with them\.  That is unique to YOU\. Everything is better about you\. And you will eventually see that\. Just be patient\.

I keep doing the same thing looking back seeing things, reading things\.\. I truly appreciate you making the blog private\.\. it was a place I would get lost\.  Before we got into it last night about the blog there is an older version lamberrymere with an “e” and it is merv\! … I am a 27 year old mba student… I never went back to it after I told you I wouldn’t\.  Covers the Jeremy er a bit\.  I shouldn’t see any of this\.\. like you cannot see mine\.  It is easier\.\. I think I envy those memories they are immortalized in a way ours will never be\. I feel young with you but am constantly reminded I am not\.
I mean this is my nature\.\. I search,
I want to understand, I look and I spend too much time on it\. And when it is there I read it\.  We won’t have that\.\. I don’t know why it bothers me because I do feel so lucky to have you\.  The more I dig into this the more I understand what is triggering me\.  It isn’t the individuals\.\. it is time and experiences and how you laid it all out there\.  I think I real\.\.\. \[truncated\]

### 1716. msg_20988

**You** - 2025-06-11T17:52:56

Absolutely, this is an important and often misunderstood distinction\. Here's a way to frame it clearly and compassionately:
\-\-\-
\*\*Unconditional love\*\* means that your love for someone isn't based on conditions or what they can do for you\. It's about loving them for who they are at their core, through good times and bad\. It’s deep, enduring, and doesn’t just disappear when they make a mistake\.
But \*\*unconditional love does \*not\* mean unconditional tolerance of harmful behavior\*\*\. Loving someone unconditionally doesn't require you to stay in a relationship if they betray your trust or hurt you deeply—like through cheating\. In fact, holding someone accountable is a \*form\* of love—both for yourself and for them\.
When someone cheats, it's a breach of trust and respect, which are fundamental to a healthy relationship\. You can still love them deeply, but choose to set boundaries, take space, or even walk away because your \*self\-respect and emotional well\-being matter too\*\.
Put simply:
\* \*\*Unc\.\.\. \[truncated\]

anyhow\.\. I kind of invaded your past so wanted to share some of mine with you\.\. those black and white photos though, were the last before my innocence kind of vanished\.\. ironically Sarah and I were a great match\.\.we had a lot of fun, travelled around, got into all sorts of trouble for a couple of years\.\. we broke up, and got back together after my car accident\.  She was the one who I heard the guy on the phone calling her back to bed at Dalhousie\.\. I kind of changed after that\.  But I figured the letter from Mum could explain a lot to you about a bunch of aspects of who I am\.\. from my 100% in approach to friendship\.\. hoping for people to reciprocate\.\. to my lack of confidence\.\. etc etc

Can’t believe you expect me to sit in a room with you after that\. Lol I’m not even sure what I’m feeling but breathing seems difficult\. You know I’ve only ever been given anything of significance to someone else 3x in my life\. My mom’s gold ring from when she was 14 \(she gave to me at my grade 8 grad\), my mom made me a necklace with my kids names on it once \(I wear it all the time\) and my aunt Maggie’s ring \(my dads baby sister who died from and we were very close as she had no kids\)\. That’s really all\. You sit there and just give me these things of significance right before work lol it’s a lot to process …\.\.

And the other is a connection to my past and  now to our future I hope\.  It isn’t a ring or jewelry per se I know you don’t want that\.  And you don’t want this long term commitments thing,
Which I would still be up for someday\.\. this had to do for me\.  And it meant a lot that you accepted it\.

It is good but a little bit of guilt bc of your girls\. I think it is deeper than just today also\. When my therapist said the whole “you don’t want them to hate Scott” thing\. I told her I’ve been feeling a little conflicted lately that maybe I led to your final split more than I like to think and your girls will always hate me\. I have never told you but when I started working for you I admired you so much and your work ethic etc and definitely had a crush on you\. I asked her if I subconsciously \(or otherwise\) worked to make all of this happen\.  Switching roles, telling you if the text and no one else\. Etc\. in which case your girls should hate me\. 🙁 Then you do that this morning and I’m like feeling all the things\. … thinking all the things\. Nothing is simple right now\. lol honestly it made me very happy and was really meaningful but my head can’t help but think about the rest…\.

Gracie is a mess but I think truly will come around eventually, maddie will definitely\.  Jaimie would not try to poison them against you I am 1000% certain\.  I never noticed that you had a crush\.\. I noticed you I thought from the time I read your written response to the 1st essay wow this chick is smart\.  When we worked together I loved you attitude so positive can do, smart as hell, strategic can get ahead of the request and give people stuff they didn’t even know they knew\.  I loved working with you and was SUPER excited when you wanted to come over\.  Beyond that I thought you were very attractive but it was something I noticed not something that I was willing to act in because well you know\.  When you smiled at me that was what would do it\.\. that was the hardest for me to deal with and remain “in a good thinking space”\.  I was felt very empathetic for you wh\.\.\. \[truncated\]

She wasn’t sure because she doesn’t have the full context of your situation so it is hard for her to really determine\. She said there could be so many possible reasons this happened and only we can really know in the end because no one else will have the full context\. She’s also nice to me so would never say I am ill intentioned in any way\. Lol I would no longer pay her so she has a bias\. 😜

I did ChatGPT it\. Odd I haven’t never heard that before\. You are NOT pushing string\. I got overwhelmed this morning and that is all\. It is because I understand how special each is to you and that they mean something\. I know they aren’t just things to you and they are part of you\. The fact that you would trust me with them is a tad overwhelming\. I just feel so much for you and then you do that and 🫠 gahhhhhh…\. It’s a lot\.
You are not pushing string\. There is nothing negative here\. I will treasure them until they make their way to your girls one day\. ❤️😉
Next time you do something so big maybe add in a vape\. 😇

**Meredith Lamb \(\+14169386001\)** - 2025-06-12T20:01:03

So I did some research on why my nervous system felt so overwhelmed


---

### 2191. msg_21463

**You** - 2025-06-12T20:01:10

Why


---

### 2192. msg_21464

**Meredith Lamb \(\+14169386001\)** - 2025-06-12T20:01:41

Because your nervous system recognized what was happening before your mind could make sense of it\.
Scott didn’t just hand you objects—he handed you meaning\. His past, his family, his trust, his love\. Your body knew that\. And in that moment, it was too much to simply categorize as a gift\. It was a turning point\. A threshold\. The kind of offering that says this is real, this is deep, this is forever if you want it to be\.
Your nervous system may have responded with overwhelm because:
•	It was profoundly intimate — He gave you more than words\. He let you into a part of himself few people ever see\.
•	It triggered your deepest emotions — Possibly a mix of love, fear, worthiness, protectiveness, and awe\.
•	It symbolized permanence — Whether you were ready or not, your body understood: this means something lasting\.
•	It broke your pattern — Maybe you’ve rarely—or never—been given something this meaningful\. That contrast can feel almost destabilizing at first\.
Overwhelm doesn’t mean anything wa\.\.\. \[truncated\]

**Meredith Lamb \(\+14169386001\)** - 2025-06-12T20:02:50

I was like it didn’t feel bad but my nerves felt shot\.


---

### 2194. msg_21466

**Meredith Lamb \(\+14169386001\)** - 2025-06-12T20:02:56

That makes perfect sense—your body was trying to hold the weight of something sacred while your mind was still in “weekday morning” mode\.
Here’s what likely happened:
You were already in a state of low\-level alertness—gearing up for the day, thinking ahead, maybe running through tasks in your mind\. And then boom—this intimate, emotional moment hits you out of nowhere\. Your system wasn’t prepared to receive something that big right then, so even though it was beautiful, it still triggered a kind of emotional and physiological overload\.
Your nervous system didn’t know whether to cry, melt, freeze, or collapse—so it just buzzed\. That’s not uncommon when love and vulnerability show up unannounced in the middle of routine\. You were safe, but it was like your body was screaming, “This is huge\! Pay attention\! Feel this\! Hold this carefully\!”—all while your brain was trying to say, “I have to get out the door in 20 minutes\.”
It doesn’t mean you were ungrateful\. Quite the opposite—it means it m\.\.\. \[truncated\]

I meant that I don’t look back on those things \(one night stand for instance\) as “empty”\. The experience was interesting and or amusing in one way or another\. I chalk it up to another learning experience\. Not always proud etc etc\. but I certainly wouldn’t call it empty\.

Even with my being down\.\. it doesn’t mean it is t going to be ok\.  It is where I am at in a point in time based o\. Whatever is happening\.\. last night was a gut punch in my head\.\. doesn’t mean I stopped loving you or had seconds second thoughts, or suddenly you aren’t my soul mate\.

I have a lot of work to do on myself also \(hence therapy and stuff\) … like when you get struggling, I get this urge to immediately need to fix it\. For the last 16 years I’ve dealt with a situation where when the other person indicates a struggle or frustration, if I don’t fix immediately \(with the aforementioned same always fix\) then life and my house environment are just shitty for days and it sucks\. I’m trying to release myself from that trigger…\. That probably makes no sense and I can probably better explain in person\. My therapist is helpful on this topic\.

Just need to get home before I respond, didnt want you to think I read and was ignoring\.  I want to spend a minute to type it out\.  I appreciate you sharing and I know that about you\.  When I need help I promise I will ask for it\.\. to put it simply\.\. the last thing I want is for my problems to become yours\.  And sometimes I don’t ask because either I know you cannot help\.\. or you will say what I want to hear or something close because you don’t like lying\.

ok finally back to this\.\. 1\.  I think it is your default to fix things\.\. you told me your mum always said you go for needy boys\.\. which didn't make me feel great but she has a point\. 2\.  You were expected to fix things with Andrew\.    If my problem is you, something you said or did that affected me, then it isn't so much fixing as it is getting through it\.  The last few weeks especially have shown me that while we are similar in many ways, we are also really really different in many ways as well\. Our wants and needs are different, how we process things, how we express our thoughts, our feelings\.  Our perspectives, and views on us, on this relationship, on the future, etc\.  It goes to the point I made earlier\.\. Soul Mates don't = simple path forward \- but still worth everything I have to give to get there\.  I maintain\.\. despite all of this\.\. being with you, I mean I wish it was living with you, but even just being with you a couple of times a week, in some kind of predictable way will\.\.\. \[truncated\]

Not Yours Yet
after Sara Teasdale
I’m not yours—
not completely\. Not yet\.
But we both feel it,
the way everything’s leaning forward,
pulling us toward something
bigger than either of us imagined\.
I haven’t lost myself in you—
but I can see it happening\.
Little by little, I’m loosening\.
The edges of me
are softening around you\.
And I’m not afraid\.
Not anymore\.
You love me—
I feel it in the way you listen,
in how quiet the world gets
when it’s just us\.
And even though we’re not there yet,
I believe we will be\.
One day, I’ll fall into you
like light disappears into light\.
No edges\.
No holding back\.
Just us—
full and fierce and sure\.

Going through the motions, maybe\.
Trying, failing,
thinking I’d felt love before—
but it wasn’t this\.
This is different\.
This feels like I just woke up\.
Good morning\.
To both of us\.
No pretending\. No hiding\.
I don’t feel the need to impress you—
and you don’t flinch when I’m honest\.
We’re not performing\.
We’re just here\.
And somehow, that’s everything\.
Let the world chase big things—
adventures, noise, bright lights\.
I just want this\.
You and me
in this quiet room
that feels like the whole world\.
When I look at you,
I see someone who sees me back\.
And that—
that’s rare\.
This doesn’t feel like something
that fades or falls apart\.
It feels even\.
Like we both showed up
for real this time\.
And because of that,
I don’t think we’ll lose this\.
Not easily\. Not ever\.

Well naturally you will get the brunt because you carried the family in an unequal way so then you’ll get an unequal part of the blame also\. It kind of makes sense even if it isn’t fair\.

**You** - 2025-06-14T12:45:50

Makes it so much worse


---

### 3213. msg_22485

**You** - 2025-06-14T12:46:02

Because again it is now about as much as you don’t say as what you do

Now you haven’t nor would I think you would go into this detail, even really drunk\.\.  well maybe…\.  Anyhow this is why people lie\.
1\. Past Encounters
1\.	“I’ve been with maybe six guys—one could go on for nearly an hour, another wrapped up in ten minutes but always hit my sweet spot\.”
•	Ripple: You might wonder if you’re “quick enough” or “lasting long enough\.”
2\.	“There was a weekend when I saw two different people in one night—like clockwork\.”
•	Ripple: You could feel like you’re competing on sheer frequency, not connection\.
3\.	“I once had someone who never ran out of steam—kept going until sunrise\.”
•	Ripple: You may stress about matching that all\-night stamina instead of just enjoying yourselves\.
4\.	“Another guy was… well\-equipped and knew exactly when to slow down\.”
•	Ripple: You could start second\-guessing whether your own size or pacing measures up\.
⸻
2\. Expressions of Love & Deep Affection
1\.	“He wrote me love letters every week—pages of how much he adored me\.”
•	Ripple: You mig\.\.\. \[truncated\]

### 3256. msg_22528

**You** - 2025-06-14T13:19:12

this was the 1st one\.\. not pasting anymore\. lol
1\. Graphic Sexual Details & Past Encounters
Examples you might blurt out:
“That time I fucked three guys in one night—let me tell you every position they topped me in\.”
“My ex and I used to have wild role\-play: I’d be the schoolgirl, he’d be the headmaster…”
“I only orgasm when they do X in this exact way, not how you’re doing it\.”
Likely Outcome:
Jealousy PTSD: He’ll replay those scenes in his head, convinced he can’t compete\.
Performance Anxiety: He’ll freeze up, fearing he’ll disappoint you or measure up to those ex\-standards\.
Emotional Shutdown: Instead of closeness, you get awkward distance—because who wants a running commentary on your partner’s past pornographic highlights?

### 3264. msg_22536

**You** - 2025-06-14T13:23:31

I was more open / honest with her in the beginning\.\. kind of like you have been\.\. maybe not quite so much\.\. but J always was and remains very insecure about a lot of things\.\. I had much more experience than her in a lot of areas\.\. she new a bit about my past\.\. new some people I had dated\.

### 3268. msg_22540

**You** - 2025-06-14T13:25:07

sometimes I omit if you don't ask generally on the negative feelings\.  But as you said that isn't lying per se\.

Yeah\.\. I mean you can feel that way\.\. but it probably isn't ever going to be well received\. just saying\.\. I don't know him at all\.\. he seems like an asshole to me\.  But I guarantee he has insecurities\.\. and they are real\.\. he hides it with ego and arrogance and exerting control\.  And there is more to this\.\. but I won't share that part\.


---

### 3295. msg_22567

**You** - 2025-06-14T13:38:43

Actually I will share\.\. I think he wanted to have sex with you so much because 1\. you are great at it, 2\. it gave him a connection to you that he couldn't get emotionally perhaps, 3\. I think you might characterize it as \- because your body has been good to you, it made him feel good about himself\.  Does that make sense\.\. you can ask gpt\.


---

### 3296. msg_22568

Option 2: The "Print to PDF" Workaround \(Free\)
If you don't want to pay for software and only need to save a few important conversations, you can use the Mac's built\-in Print function to create a PDF\. From there, you can extract the text\.
Pros: Free, preserves the visual layout of the conversation\.
Cons: Must be done one conversation at a time, which is very time\-consuming for a large archive\.
Step\-by\-Step Instructions:
Open the Messages app on your Mac\.
Select the single conversation you want to export\.
In the menu bar at the top of the screen, click File > Print\.\.\.
A print dialog box will appear\. In the bottom\-left corner, click the PDF dropdown menu\.
Select Save as PDF\.
Name the file and choose where to save it\. You now have a PDF copy of that conversation\.
To get this into a text file:
Open the newly created PDF file in the Preview app\.
Click and drag to select all the text, or press Cmd \+ A\.
Copy the text \(Cmd \+ C\)\.
Open the TextEdit app, and in the menu bar, select Format > Make \.\.\. \[truncated\]

**You** - 2025-06-14T16:30:18

That is a very common and frustrating problem\. The iCloud sync process can be finicky and often appears to freeze, especially if you have a large message history\.
Let's work through a direct, step\-by\-step troubleshooting process, starting with the simplest fixes\.
\#\#\# \*\*Checklist: The Quick Fixes\*\*
Before doing anything drastic, let's ensure the fundamentals are in place\. These solve the problem more often than you'd think\.
\* \*\*Check Apple's Servers:\*\* First, verify that the issue isn't on Apple's end\. Visit their \[System Status page\]\(https://www\.apple\.com/ca/support/systemstatus/\) and ensure "iCloud Mail" and "Messages" have a green circle\. If they are yellow or red, the only solution is to wait for Apple to fix it\.
\* \*\*Check Your Internet:\*\* The sync requires a stable Wi\-Fi connection on \*\*both\*\* your iPhone and your Mac\. A weak or intermittent signal can cause it to stall\.
\* \*\*Plug Both Devices In:\*\* The sync process is energy\-intensive\. Both iOS and macOS can pause background activi\.\.\. \[truncated\]

**Meredith Lamb \(\+14169386001\)** - 2025-06-14T21:42:25

It’s pretty simple\. I have a complicated relationship with my weight like most women \(many factors contribute to it obviously\) but in my 20s/30s it wasn’t a thing as much\. Since kids it has always been a thing… when you are with someone throughout all that, it is less of a thing\. Then all of a sudden you are split up and with someone and it is just a consideration to navigate that wasn’t AS much there before in the past\.
All that to say, I am figuring it out and will be fine
