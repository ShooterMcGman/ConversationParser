| As I said honestly talking about me and my situation and my feelings is a waste of time\.  I will sum it up for you\.\. I miss you all the time, I do not see a great near term at all\.\. and that sucks tremendously, I don‚Äôt see a feasible medium term, equally sucks, possibly worse\.  I belief in the long term which is what I hold on to \- all I can do\.  I had control of my emotions before last weekend\.  It was too good for me‚Ä¶ then, to give it up and realize not coming back for a really really long time in the face of the shit I was getting at home\.\. was too much for the past few days\.

**You** - 2025-07-06T04:21:37

We are just in such different places right now‚Ä¶ very hard for me to process everything and impossible to be optimistic and not wanting you to see that makes everything worse for me\.

**You** - 2025-07-06T04:23:05

Anyhow I love you Mer\.\. a single constant that will never change\.\. but I don‚Äôt think I will ever really be happy until we can have some semblance to of a normal relationship, so will have to wait\.

I want to say ‚Äúnoted‚Äù but I know that will be taken the wrong way lol\. I just feel I am self destructing again\.\. and cannot seem to stop myself\.  And now this is the first step to you pulling away, have been in this story before\. I understand the list of worries and anxieties \- go chill\.


---

### 60. msg_28819

**You** - 2025-07-06T07:40:27

Ps you can share your anxieties with me\.\. when I am solving a problem I am not thinking about my own and it makes me feel useful\.\. unless most of those anxieties are about me\.\. then that‚Äôs another story‚Ä¶\.  Kk now I am done\.

Reaction: üò¢ from Scott Hicks
My list of anxieties is huge and I‚Äôd rather not focus on them today ‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs more like a running list of to dos and worries in my head\. One of them lingering is hoping I‚Äôm not preg and have to take care of anything a couple weeks on top of everything else\.
You feel like you are self destructing\. I feel like I already have but have resigned myself to it for a while and hoping to rebound eventually\.


---

### 64. msg_28823

### 65. msg_28824

**You** - 2025-07-06T08:34:36

Sorry I thought the car message was an invitation to not have a deep conversation lol\.\. I just got a sense things were lighter for you\.\. you seemed happier, you portrayed things as going really well\.  I guess I misunderstood\.\. I don't want to bring anything up, I don't want to ruin your day\.  Pregnancy was at the back of my mind as well\.

I think the difference between our situations is that my girls are not outwardly miserable and they want to have a good time\. I can‚Äôt be this depressed presence focusing on my own shitty problems on the weekend around them\. I keep it together for them\. It doesn‚Äôt mean I‚Äôm happy per se\.
