Was thinking while cleaning\. Not “hesitant” but you are kind of scary so “afraid” could be accurate but that seems severe\. More anxious


---

### 97. msg_16244

**You** - 2025-06-01T13:42:10

Scary how?  ☹️


---

### 98. msg_16245

**Meredith Lamb \(\+14169386001\)** - 2025-06-01T13:51:52

I guess just your history of shutting off so completely and not for a short time, for many years\. It’s a bit scary\. But it’s okay, I understand it and it is part of who you are so I’m processing it and trying NOT to be afraid\. You are worth it\. :\)

### 99. msg_16246

**You** - 2025-06-01T13:53:57

Mer\.\. sigh\.\. before I shut down\.\. to protect my feelings\.\. but I never stopped trying with j not until January of this year\.\. and even after that I still tried to support make smarter decisions take care of herself etc\.


---

### 100. msg_16247

**You** - 2025-06-01T13:54:42

I think you think me shutting down means I give up\.\. it doesn’t\.  Problem with j and I was the spark was never there to begin with\.\.

### 101. msg_16248

**You** - 2025-06-01T13:57:40

And I still committed was there for her supported her\. Yeah obligation and loyalty was big and loyalty is core to me\. But I don’t think you will ever need to worry about that honestly\.   You engage\.  I think if we ever ran into a tough time\.\. 1 we would communicate, I have already shown the level of communication you can expect from me\.\. 2 we support each other\.\. shutting down isn’t my first second third etc etc option\.  3 I don’t think you would let me, you have demonstrated that already and you have seen how I have reacted\.


---

### 102. msg_16249

### 106. msg_16253

**Meredith Lamb \(\+14169386001\)** - 2025-06-01T13:59:37

I think I understand, really, logically I do but because I wasn’t there to experience it, there are some tricky gaps sometimes that come up in my head\. \(Not now\.\)
Why would I be afraid of how you feel when I feel the same way but just am not as verbally expressive?


---

### 107. msg_16254

**You** - 2025-06-01T13:59:38

But even if i shut down now because of how challenging this is\.\. it isn’t that I want to shut you out\.  I want to preserve myself for when we can be together

Reaction: ❤️ from Meredith Lamb
If you hurt me I won’t shut down I will tell you\.  I told you right away on Friday when I was having a hard time\.\. I didn’t shut you out\.\. we can deal with shit mer I am not worried about that\.\. I am not worried for when we have our first “fight” “disagreement” or whatever you want to call it\.\.  I was for a long time\.\. because we hadn’t really defined what this is\.\. I am not worried about that anymore\.


---

### 110. msg_16257

**You** - 2025-06-01T14:03:27

And the closer we get to a normal relationship a lot of this stuff will just completely go away\.  As I get used to you, the evolving situation, and my crazy feelings\.


---

### 111. msg_16258

**You** - 2025-06-01T14:03:44

### 112. msg_16259

**You** - 2025-06-01T14:05:55

**You** - 2025-06-01T14:21:30

It won’t be though\.  Every chance we get to spend time I feel “better” no other word for it\. Once the settlement agreements are in place
That will be huge\. Once you move out and Jaimie goes to Moncton will be another massive milestone\.\. in the meantime we take, find or make small opportunities\.

If Jaimie said anything they would have to do an investigation\. That would be annoying, potentially lengthy, intrusive, etc


---

### 134. msg_16281

**You** - 2025-06-01T14:25:21

She won’t because it would embarrass her and it would put the kids future inheritance at risk\.

But in a week it won’t matter


---

### 137. msg_16284

**You** - 2025-06-01T14:26:05

So from a logical perspective she definitely won’t\.\. even if she didn’t care about that she still wouldn’t, I trust her in that and how she reacted when I suggested she might do it\.


---

### 138. msg_16285

**You** - 2025-06-01T14:26:25

Sry hurt and offended I would suggest it

### 142. msg_16289

**You** - 2025-06-01T14:27:11

She would never do that\.\. more likely to say something mean to you under her breath…

I didn’t care if he lost his job\. I wasn’t thinking at all

### 148. msg_16295

Yeah she is not there

---

### 153. msg_16300

**You** - 2025-06-01T14:29:03

Again too much attention to herself


---

### 154. msg_16301

**You** - 2025-06-01T14:32:42

I don’t think it would yield anything there was no undue influence no unfair benefit you got the position back in September\. Like


---

### 155. msg_16302

**You** - 2025-06-01T14:33:27

Even if they felt we slightly crossed the line even being emotional with each other there is nothing major here\. And you made the move to switch jobs\.\.


---

### 156. msg_16303

**Meredith Lamb \(\+14169386001\)** - 2025-06-01T14:35:31

True but an investigation would suck so bad


---

### 157. msg_16304

**Meredith Lamb \(\+14169386001\)** - 2025-06-01T14:36:05

And we obviously crossed some line because we hit it from everyone


---

### 158. msg_16305

**You** - 2025-06-01T14:36:37

Mmm I don’t agree with your logic


---

### 159. msg_16306

**You** - 2025-06-01T14:37:40

I think that assuming people would naturally think we crossed a line is the reason\. I feel like that is as reasonable as your suggestions\.  We hid it because we were afraid what people would think or draw conclusions that might not be true\.


---

### 160. msg_16307

**You** - 2025-06-01T14:38:13

Not necessarily that we actually did what people might think\.

So my logic is sound, but just can’t be proven

### 169. msg_16316

**Meredith Lamb \(\+14169386001\)** - 2025-06-01T14:41:47

**You** - 2025-06-01T21:48:03

Query \- Is there an adage in relationships about not trying to compete with what came before—especially meaningful or positive memories? My girlfriend and I are both 47 and coming out of significant, long\-term relationships\. She’s mentioned that she’s interested in us exploring things a little more openly—perhaps reconnecting with a different kind of energy or freedom she experienced in earlier chapters of her life, long before her last relationship\.
She hasn’t fully explained what that means yet, and I get the sense it might be hard to put into words—or maybe she’s still figuring it out\. I also know I have some insecurities of my own\. I’m not trying to compare myself to the past, and I don’t want to feel jealous of it—but I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t still finding my footing with it all\.

**You** - 2025-06-01T21:50:43

Here is the response\.\. which I found very relevant\.
Scott, this is deeply thoughtful—and emotionally honest\. You're absolutely right: you can’t and shouldn’t compete with the past, especially someone’s emotional or romantic history\. There is a kind of adage here, though it’s more wisdom than a single quote\. It’s something like:
“You’re not here to replace the past; you’re here to build what comes next\.”
Here’s the heart of the matter:
🧠 Perspective: Past vs\. Present vs\. Future
The past is like a photo album—it can be cherished but not relived\.
You are her present—and maybe her future—not her past\. That’s already incredibly meaningful\.
Memories aren’t threats unless we make them so\. They’re reference points, not rivals\.
❤️ The Emotional Equation
You’re both 47, which means you carry more than just luggage—you’ve got trunks of experiences\. But you’re not starting over, you’re starting from\.
Your insecurity makes sense—especially when the conversation turns to opening up emotionally or se\.\.\. \[truncated\]

I asked ai to articulate for me and it said this which I agree with but could never write on my own:
You’re not asking for novelty just for the sake of “trying new things\.” You’re also not drawing on past relationships as a blueprint\. In fact, you’re deliberately not trying to recreate what came before\. You’re craving a kind of intimacy that’s emotionally alive, co\-created, and attuned to this relationship—not stuck in old grooves\.
And the heart of it is this:
You’ve seen what it looks like when someone shuts down—sexually and emotionally—and you’re afraid of that happening again\. That fear makes you want to invite openness now, before anything gets stuck or withdrawn\. But when you asked him about evolving together, he zeroed in on “what exactly do you mean?”—because he was trying to do something “right,” when really you were speaking to a way of being\.
Here’s a different way you could try to explain it to him:

### 369. msg_16516

**Meredith Lamb \(\+14169386001\)** - 2025-06-01T22:22:45

So given the fact that I’m not really clear on the level of detail my stupid messed up self went into, regardless of that, I apologize, that was dumb of me\. And if you want me to clarify anything \(groan\) I will\. But if you want to never speak of it ever again, I’m equally good \(or thrilled\) with that


---

### 370. msg_16517

**You** - 2025-06-01T22:23:55

There was enough detail for me to fill in some blanks\.  so maybe the second option\.

### 372. msg_16519

**You** - 2025-06-01T22:25:17

I mean I thought you might have remembered this\.\. so when you referenced open and then J and C I thought ok I might get something specific here\.\. but then nothing\.\. then I thought back and tried to figure it out myself\.\. but could not\.\. only word that I think sums up both relationships well is "Intense"


---

### 373. msg_16520

**You** - 2025-06-01T22:25:38

Yeah should have left this one alone\. Sorry for bringing it up\.


---

### 374. msg_16521

**You** - 2025-06-01T22:26:03

I was just trying to figure out what to do\. just too much there to think through

### 376. msg_16523

**Meredith Lamb \(\+14169386001\)** - 2025-06-01T22:29:19

Just to re\-iterate, I’m not looking to re\-create anything there\. Yes I had fun and yes, it was a very different vibe than my time with Andrew however, there were a lot of negatives that haven’t been discussed at all\. So keep that in mind\.
You and I have started something so much more amazing for so many different reasons\. I think I am just fearful of it going away\. Honestly\. I think that is where this all stemmed from\.


---

### 377. msg_16524

---

### 379. msg_16526

**You** - 2025-06-01T22:35:17

Like I said people are honest when they are drunk\.\. lol\.\. I do believe what you are saying "You and I have started something so much more amazing for so many different reasons\."  But I have told you before I was worried that I could not keep up or keep you interested\.\. because of the "interesting" things you have shared with me\.  I mean let me unpack this a bit differently\.\. I am a people pleaser \- You are an internalizer and challenging to read\.  So hard to tell what works and what doesn't because again communication\.\.\.\. I think we have an amazing time together\.  Then a conversation goes to concerns that my level of intensity might not last, and am I "open" and wondering if our relationship is going to evolve\.\. which I am just not sure to what you are referring because there was so much, am I not doing the right things\.\. sending the right signals\.  I mean it just makes me question myself\.  But yeah we are all good\.\. just again alot to process Mer\.\. that's all\.


---

### 380. msg_16527

**You** - 2025-06-01T22:36:03

So yeah\.\. I will put the open thing in a box with the other stuff\.\. I mean I thought I was showing that already\.\. but maybe not\.\.  and I will just keep moving forward\.


---

### 381. msg_16528

**Meredith Lamb \(\+14169386001\)** - 2025-06-01T22:39:00

You have been for sure \- incredibly \- but again, was just anxious and I’m still figuring us out too\. I was just talking and not really thinking it would be taken as you are doing anything incorrectly\. You are not\. At all\. Ugh, I wish I knew everything I said that night but I will have sit with that one\. Price I pay\. Please don’t question yourself\.


---

### 382. msg_16529

**You** - 2025-06-01T22:40:26

It's fine\.\. I will just sleep it off\.\. stuck in my head for the moment\.\. but it will likely get relegated to the back with the rest of the shit I remember\.\. as long as I don't think about it it is fine\.

No you didn't I think you just wanted to share\.\. I just wasn't sure why\.\. again it doesn't matter\.\. I don't feel like you are in a bad place\.\. I just try to piece together all of the stuff I hear\.\. and it is confusing\.\. that's all\.

**You** - 2025-06-02T07:21:09

Sorry I meant to mention this to you last night\.\. I will now
And then I won’t raise the topic myself again\.\.   what really got me that night was after telling me everything\.\. especially about Chris\.\. you had told me you reached out to him\.\. I think in late march\.  But he hasn’t gotten back to you or something and you looked really really sad\.\. for like 5 minutes and didnt really say anything after that\.  I mean I know you were friends and whatever else not sure how that worked or what came first\.\. Ok sorry not trying to reopen I just forgot to mention you said you didn’t remember, so that was probably the worst of it\.  Anyhow just out of shower getting ready to head out\.\. again not trying to prolong this\.\. but forgot to mention and thought you would want to know\.


---

### 400. msg_16547

**Meredith Lamb \(\+14169386001\)** - 2025-06-02T07:27:29

I remember you mentioning that and I do remember saying it also\. Not the silent 5 min afterwards\. We were very good friends after the fucked up crazy stuff and we reconnect and chat every so often \(last time when his dad died\) but only as friends even tho he would probably do more but honestly he is GAY but thinks he is bi\. I wouldn’t ever do anything with him other than be friends\. I wasn’t the greatest friend to him after I had kids so when he didn’t respond it makes me feel like I did something wrong\. \(Because I did neglect our friendship\.\) That’s all

He associates the years of me being obsessed with working out as happy because I was happier when really I was just a doormat and then woke up\. So he has been  asking me to start working out for the last 3 yrs because he thought  it would fix everything\. A little clueless\. So the\. He was all \(for the last 3 yrs\) “you are going to leave me, start working out and then meet someone else”

Listen l am having a hard time atm\. But let me assure you my being quiet isn’t shutting down\.  If we were together this would likely be sorted already\.  But I am here by myself with my head so it is a bit harder\. I love you\.\. I am not going anywhere unless you make it so\.\. I am here whatever comes next for as long as you will have me\. But while I haven’t had Thea experiences before you have and how you spoke about them in detail it is a lot to process and work through\.  I have to get my head right I don’t think you can do that for me\.

I am happy you had such a good life and adventures\.  I am sooooo jealous\.\. that I couldn’t be part of them\.\. feeling the way I do, feeling like you are the only one that matters to me\. An irrational part of me hates the fact that it took me this long to find you and I missed out on so much\.


---

### 465. msg_16612

**You** - 2025-06-02T10:30:35

It is stupid\.\. and irrational and immature\. There is so much I want to share that just can’t happen we are past those years\.\. really breaks me a bit which is why I was sensitive to the stories\.   I don’t want to shut that part of your life off between us\.\.
I know Andrew have you a hard time for that you told me that as well\.\. I think you hoped I wasn’t him and when I reacted this way I was disgusted with myself\.

**Meredith Lamb \(\+14169386001\)** - 2025-06-02T10:41:37

Not sure about that honestly\. Haven’t thought about it\. All I know is that I have to make some changes and smarten up\. Which is generally a point that I eventually get to\. Think I’m here\. I think you are struggling atm simply because of my behaviour and for no other reason\.

Forgot to tell you most importantly Hugh said I was damn luck to find someone the way I described you and how I described my feelings\.  Most people don’t… and some do but don’t recognize it\. While he did suggest stopping it was only from the perspective of trying to make it easier\.  Thought that might make you feel a bit better… Love you xoxo🥰\. Have a good sleep\. ❤️\. All of these stupid what if conversations will be meaningless in the not to distant future\.\. I am hopeful\.  Nite\.

---

### 890. msg_17037

**You** - 2025-06-04T04:29:50

lol u know I always thought admired was an odd word to choose\.  Kind of like saying someone has a nice personality for lack of a better reference to call out\.  But I have to say in all honesty I admire you tremendously more so the more I learn about you and your life\.  You have maximized what life has to offer for all those around you and just made it “better”\. For Andrew to call you selfish is such an injustice because to me you are selfless\.  You have lived your life not only for yourself but both for those most important to you, as well as others not so close, always willing to give your time, help, support etc\.  So odd word or not Mer I admire you so much, it makes me want to be more like you in some ways\.  And I never thought I would be lucky enough to be in a relationship with someone like you\.

### 893. msg_17040

**You** - 2025-06-04T04:33:39

Additionally please think about what I suggested re verbalizing\.  This would be very uncomfortable for me too\.  But I think it might be worth trying perhaps\.\. we can always turf it if we want\.  I mean it could be a while until we get the opportunity so maybe take some
Time to think on it\.

I think it is just nice to have someone I can trust and who I know will support me just as I want to support you\.\. it seems a bit off now because of how we both deal with distance differently but I don’t want you to get scared away because oh no another needy guy lol\.

I’m so sad\. He was so insulting tonight\. I lost it on him\. Here’s my ChatGPT: I’m going through a separation and it is getting nasty\. My husband that I am separated from just asked me if I want to only have the kids on weekends\. What do you make of this?


---

### 1392. msg_17539

**Meredith Lamb \(\+14169386001\)** - 2025-06-04T21:45:01

I’m really sorry you’re going through this — separation is hard enough without it becoming contentious\.
When your husband asks if you “only want the kids on weekends,” it could mean a few things, depending on tone, context, and history between you:
1\.	Testing boundaries or leverage: He might be trying to assert control over the custody dynamic, possibly pre\-empting legal discussions\. This kind of question can be a way of probing how much parenting time you’re aiming for, or trying to shape the narrative\.
2\.	Manipulation or provocation: If things are getting nasty, he might be trying to provoke an emotional reaction, implying that you don’t want to be with the kids full\-time — a painful and often unfair suggestion\.
3\.	Literal inquiry \(less likely\): If custody hasn’t been fully discussed, he might actually be asking what your ideal arrangement is, but the phrasing still seems loaded and dismissive\.
4\.	Weaponizing parenting time: It could be an early sign he intends to push for more custo\.\.\. \[truncated\]

**Meredith Lamb \(\+14169386001\)** - 2025-06-07T18:43:11

You can probably infer the prompt somewhat\. Response…That’s powerful—and deeply telling\.
Two months in, most people are still hovering in the physical and emotional shallows\. But you’re describing a connection that keeps deepening with each encounter\. That’s not just chemistry—it’s emotional gravity\. The kind that pulls two people closer not just in body, but in trust, vulnerability, and mutual care\.
When making love becomes more intense and more meaningful over time, it usually means something bigger is taking shape beneath the surface\. You’re not just sharing bodies—you’re unfolding into each other\. It’s as if each time brings a new layer of truth or tenderness, like your hearts are slowly becoming less guarded, more known\.
It’s beautiful—and probably a little scary too\. Because when it means more, it carries more weight\. More potential\. More risk\. More “what now?” questions, even as your body and heart say yes\.
How are you feeling about this? Does it feel safe, or does it stir somet\.\.\. \[truncated\]

**Meredith Lamb \(\+14169386001\)** - 2025-06-07T19:09:55

No I’m just chatting\. :\) more… insightful\. ChatGPT knows me now\.
You’re loving someone fully, openly, and with your whole self—and that’s brave\. But it’s also exposing\. When the connection keeps deepening, so does the risk\. It’s no longer just wanting him—it’s needing him in some emotional way\. That shift can feel both beautiful and terrifying\.
You might be thinking:
•	What if he pulls away?
•	What if I’ve tied my happiness to something that can’t be secure in the long run?
Loving someone while still in the shadow of uncertainty—because of circumstance, timing, secrecy, or power dynamics—is a tightrope walk\. And even when it feels safe in the moment, the “what ifs” can start whispering\.
But the fact that you’re not ignoring those whispers—that you’re giving them air here—means you’re taking care of your heart\. You’re not naïve\.

Tried
To reverse engineer the prompts you might have used\.
Here are a few pared\-down, everyday prompts she might have tried—each in a couple of quick back\-and\-forths, with none of the fancier phrasing lifted from the reply:
⸻
Prompt Set A
1\.	“We’re about two months in and our lovemaking feels stronger every time—what’s up with that?”
2\.	“How do I even make sense of how it’s making me feel?”
⸻
Prompt Set B
1\.	“Me and my partner both just got out of rough splits and now, two months later, sex keeps getting more intense\. Is that normal?”
2\.	“What should I be asking myself about it?”
⸻
Prompt Set C
1\.	“It’s been eight weeks together and every time we’re intimate it feels deeper\. Why do you think that is?”
2\.	“Any thoughts on how I should think through what this means?”
⸻
