You engage\.  I think if we ever ran into a tough time\.\. 1 we would communicate, I have already shown the level of communication you can expect from me\.\. 2 we support each other\.\. shutting down isn‚Äôt my first second third etc etc option\.  3 I don‚Äôt think you would let me, you have demonstrated that already and you have seen how I have reacted\.

**Meredith Lamb \(\+14169386001\)** - 2025-06-01T13:59:37

I think I understand, really, logically I do but because I wasn‚Äôt there to experience it, there are some tricky gaps sometimes that come up in my head\. \(Not now\.\)
Why would I be afraid of how you feel when I feel the same way but just am not as verbally expressive?


---

### 107. msg_16254

**You** - 2025-06-01T13:59:38

If you hurt me I won‚Äôt shut down I will tell you\.  I told you right away on Friday when I was having a hard time\.\. I didn‚Äôt shut you out\.\. we can deal with shit mer I am not worried about that\.\. I am not worried for when we have our first ‚Äúfight‚Äù ‚Äúdisagreement‚Äù or whatever you want to call it\.\.  I was for a long time\.\. because we hadn‚Äôt really defined what this is\.\. I am not worried about that anymore\.

So from a logical perspective she definitely won‚Äôt\.\. even if she didn‚Äôt care about that she still wouldn‚Äôt, I trust her in that and how she reacted when I suggested she might do it\.

### 155. msg_16302

**You** - 2025-06-01T14:33:27

Even if they felt we slightly crossed the line even being emotional with each other there is nothing major here\. And you made the move to switch jobs\.\.

### 157. msg_16304

**Meredith Lamb \(\+14169386001\)** - 2025-06-01T14:36:05

Mmm I don‚Äôt agree with your logic

**You** - 2025-06-01T14:37:40

I think that assuming people would naturally think we crossed a line is the reason\. I feel like that is as reasonable as your suggestions\.  We hid it because we were afraid what people would think or draw conclusions that might not be true\.

### 160. msg_16307

**You** - 2025-06-01T21:48:03

Query \- Is there an adage in relationships about not trying to compete with what came before‚Äîespecially meaningful or positive memories? My girlfriend and I are both 47 and coming out of significant, long\-term relationships\. She‚Äôs mentioned that she‚Äôs interested in us exploring things a little more openly‚Äîperhaps reconnecting with a different kind of energy or freedom she experienced in earlier chapters of her life, long before her last relationship\.
She hasn‚Äôt fully explained what that means yet, and I get the sense it might be hard to put into words‚Äîor maybe she‚Äôs still figuring it out\. I also know I have some insecurities of my own\. I‚Äôm not trying to compare myself to the past, and I don‚Äôt want to feel jealous of it‚Äîbut I‚Äôd be lying if I said I wasn‚Äôt still finding my footing with it all\.

Here is the response\.\. which I found very relevant\.
Scott, this is deeply thoughtful‚Äîand emotionally honest\. You're absolutely right: you can‚Äôt and shouldn‚Äôt compete with the past, especially someone‚Äôs emotional or romantic history\. There is a kind of adage here, though it‚Äôs more wisdom than a single quote\. It‚Äôs something like:
‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not here to replace the past; you‚Äôre here to build what comes next\.‚Äù
Here‚Äôs the heart of the matter:
üß† Perspective: Past vs\. Present vs\. Future
The past is like a photo album‚Äîit can be cherished but not relived\.
You are her present‚Äîand maybe her future‚Äînot her past\. That‚Äôs already incredibly meaningful\.
Memories aren‚Äôt threats unless we make them so\. They‚Äôre reference points, not rivals\.
‚ù§Ô∏è The Emotional Equation
You‚Äôre both 47, which means you carry more than just luggage‚Äîyou‚Äôve got trunks of experiences\. But you‚Äôre not starting over, you‚Äôre starting from\.
Your insecurity makes sense‚Äîespecially when the conversation turns to opening up emotionally or se\.\.\. \[truncated\]

I asked ai to articulate for me and it said this which I agree with but could never write on my own:
You‚Äôre not asking for novelty just for the sake of ‚Äútrying new things\.‚Äù You‚Äôre also not drawing on past relationships as a blueprint\. In fact, you‚Äôre deliberately not trying to recreate what came before\. You‚Äôre craving a kind of intimacy that‚Äôs emotionally alive, co\-created, and attuned to this relationship‚Äînot stuck in old grooves\.
And the heart of it is this:
You‚Äôve seen what it looks like when someone shuts down‚Äîsexually and emotionally‚Äîand you‚Äôre afraid of that happening again\. That fear makes you want to invite openness now, before anything gets stuck or withdrawn\. But when you asked him about evolving together, he zeroed in on ‚Äúwhat exactly do you mean?‚Äù‚Äîbecause he was trying to do something ‚Äúright,‚Äù when really you were speaking to a way of being\.
Here‚Äôs a different way you could try to explain it to him:

### 369. msg_16516

**Meredith Lamb \(\+14169386001\)** - 2025-06-01T22:22:45

So given the fact that I‚Äôm not really clear on the level of detail my stupid messed up self went into, regardless of that, I apologize, that was dumb of me\. And if you want me to clarify anything \(groan\) I will\. But if you want to never speak of it ever again, I‚Äôm equally good \(or thrilled\) with that


---

### 370. msg_16517

**You** - 2025-06-01T22:23:55

There was enough detail for me to fill in some blanks\.  so maybe the second option\.

### 372. msg_16519

**You** - 2025-06-01T22:25:17

I mean I thought you might have remembered this\.\. so when you referenced open and then J and C I thought ok I might get something specific here\.\. but then nothing\.\. then I thought back and tried to figure it out myself\.\. but could not\.\. only word that I think sums up both relationships well is "Intense"


---

### 373. msg_16520

**You** - 2025-06-01T22:25:38

Yeah should have left this one alone\. Sorry for bringing it up\.

### 374. msg_16521

**You** - 2025-06-01T22:26:03

### 376. msg_16523

**Meredith Lamb \(\+14169386001\)** - 2025-06-01T22:29:19

Just to re\-iterate, I‚Äôm not looking to re\-create anything there\. Yes I had fun and yes, it was a very different vibe than my time with Andrew however, there were a lot of negatives that haven‚Äôt been discussed at all\. So keep that in mind\.
You and I have started something so much more amazing for so many different reasons\. I think I am just fearful of it going away\. Honestly\. I think that is where this all stemmed from\.


---

### 377. msg_16524

---

### 379. msg_16526

**You** - 2025-06-01T22:35:17

Like I said people are honest when they are drunk\.\. lol\.\. I do believe what you are saying "You and I have started something so much more amazing for so many different reasons\."  But I have told you before I was worried that I could not keep up or keep you interested\.\. because of the "interesting" things you have shared with me\.  I mean let me unpack this a bit differently\.\. I am a people pleaser \- You are an internalizer and challenging to read\.  So hard to tell what works and what doesn't because again communication\.\.\.\. I think we have an amazing time together\.  Then a conversation goes to concerns that my level of intensity might not last, and am I "open" and wondering if our relationship is going to evolve\.\. which I am just not sure to what you are referring because there was so much, am I not doing the right things\.\. sending the right signals\.  I mean it just makes me question myself\.  But yeah we are all good\.\. just again alot to process Mer\.\. that's all\.


---

### 380. msg_16527

**You** - 2025-06-01T22:36:03

So yeah\.\. I will put the open thing in a box with the other stuff\.\. I mean I thought I was showing that already\.\. but maybe not\.\.  and I will just keep moving forward\.


---

### 381. msg_16528

**Meredith Lamb \(\+14169386001\)** - 2025-06-01T22:39:00

You have been for sure \- incredibly \- but again, was just anxious and I‚Äôm still figuring us out too\. I was just talking and not really thinking it would be taken as you are doing anything incorrectly\. You are not\. At all\. Ugh, I wish I knew everything I said that night but I will have sit with that one\. Price I pay\. Please don‚Äôt question yourself\.


---

### 382. msg_16529

**You** - 2025-06-01T22:40:26

It's fine\.\. I will just sleep it off\.\. stuck in my head for the moment\.\. but it will likely get relegated to the back with the rest of the shit I remember\.\. as long as I don't think about it it is fine\.

No you didn't I think you just wanted to share\.\. I just wasn't sure why\.\. again it doesn't matter\.\. I don't feel like you are in a bad place\.\. I just try to piece together all of the stuff I hear\.\. and it is confusing\.\. that's all\.

**You** - 2025-06-02T07:21:09

Sorry I meant to mention this to you last night\.\. I will now
And then I won‚Äôt raise the topic myself again\.\.   what really got me that night was after telling me everything\.\. especially about Chris\.\. you had told me you reached out to him\.\. I think in late march\.  But he hasn‚Äôt gotten back to you or something and you looked really really sad\.\. for like 5 minutes and didnt really say anything after that\.  I mean I know you were friends and whatever else not sure how that worked or what came first\.\. Ok sorry not trying to reopen I just forgot to mention you said you didn‚Äôt remember, so that was probably the worst of it\.  Anyhow just out of shower getting ready to head out\.\. again not trying to prolong this\.\. but forgot to mention and thought you would want to know\.

**Meredith Lamb \(\+14169386001\)** - 2025-06-02T07:27:29

I remember you mentioning that and I do remember saying it also\. Not the silent 5 min afterwards\. We were very good friends after the fucked up crazy stuff and we reconnect and chat every so often \(last time when his dad died\) but only as friends even tho he would probably do more but honestly he is GAY but thinks he is bi\. I wouldn‚Äôt ever do anything with him other than be friends\. I wasn‚Äôt the greatest friend to him after I had kids so when he didn‚Äôt respond it makes me feel like I did something wrong\. \(Because I did neglect our friendship\.\) That‚Äôs all

Listen l am having a hard time atm\. But let me assure you my being quiet isn‚Äôt shutting down\.  If we were together this would likely be sorted already\.  But I am here by myself with my head so it is a bit harder\. I love you\.\. I am not going anywhere unless you make it so\.\. I am here whatever comes next for as long as you will have me\. But while I haven‚Äôt had Thea experiences before you have and how you spoke about them in detail it is a lot to process and work through\.

While he did suggest stopping it was only from the perspective of trying to make it easier\.  Thought that might make you feel a bit better‚Ä¶ Love you xoxoü•∞\. Have a good sleep\. ‚ù§Ô∏è\.

### 890. msg_17037

**You** - 2025-06-04T04:29:50

lol u know I always thought admired was an odd word to choose\.  Kind of like saying someone has a nice personality for lack of a better reference to call out\.  But I have to say in all honesty I admire you tremendously more so the more I learn about you and your life\.  You have maximized what life has to offer for all those around you and just made it ‚Äúbetter‚Äù\. For Andrew to call you selfish is such an injustice because to me you are selfless\.  You have lived your life not only for yourself but both for those most important to you, as well as others not so close, always willing to give your time, help, support etc\.  So odd word or not Mer I admire you so much, it makes me want to be more like you in some ways\.  And I never thought I would be lucky enough to be in a relationship with someone like you\.

**You** - 2025-06-04T04:33:39

Additionally please think about what I suggested re verbalizing\.  This would be very uncomfortable for me too\.  But I think it might be worth trying perhaps\.\. we can always turf it if we want\.  I mean it could be a while until we get the opportunity so maybe take some
Time to think on it\.

I‚Äôm so sad\. He was so insulting tonight\. I lost it on him\. Here‚Äôs my ChatGPT: I‚Äôm going through a separation and it is getting nasty\. My husband that I am separated from just asked me if I want to only have the kids on weekends\. What do you make of this?


---

### 1392. msg_17539

**Meredith Lamb \(\+14169386001\)** - 2025-06-04T21:45:01

I‚Äôm really sorry you‚Äôre going through this ‚Äî separation is hard enough without it becoming contentious\.
When your husband asks if you ‚Äúonly want the kids on weekends,‚Äù it could mean a few things, depending on tone, context, and history between you:
1\.	Testing boundaries or leverage: He might be trying to assert control over the custody dynamic, possibly pre\-empting legal discussions\. This kind of question can be a way of probing how much parenting time you‚Äôre aiming for, or trying to shape the narrative\.
2\.	Manipulation or provocation: If things are getting nasty, he might be trying to provoke an emotional reaction, implying that you don‚Äôt want to be with the kids full\-time ‚Äî a painful and often unfair suggestion\.
3\.	Literal inquiry \(less likely\): If custody hasn‚Äôt been fully discussed, he might actually be asking what your ideal arrangement is, but the phrasing still seems loaded and dismissive\.
4\.	Weaponizing parenting time: It could be an early sign he intends to push for more custo\.\.\. \[truncated\]

You can probably infer the prompt somewhat\. Response‚Ä¶That‚Äôs powerful‚Äîand deeply telling\.
Two months in, most people are still hovering in the physical and emotional shallows\. But you‚Äôre describing a connection that keeps deepening with each encounter\. That‚Äôs not just chemistry‚Äîit‚Äôs emotional gravity\. The kind that pulls two people closer not just in body, but in trust, vulnerability, and mutual care\.
When making love becomes more intense and more meaningful over time, it usually means something bigger is taking shape beneath the surface\. You‚Äôre not just sharing bodies‚Äîyou‚Äôre unfolding into each other\. It‚Äôs as if each time brings a new layer of truth or tenderness, like your hearts are slowly becoming less guarded, more known\.
It‚Äôs beautiful‚Äîand probably a little scary too\. Because when it means more, it carries more weight\. More potential\. More risk\. More ‚Äúwhat now?‚Äù questions, even as your body and heart say yes\.
How are you feeling about this? Does it feel safe, or does it stir somet\.\.\. \[truncated\]

No I‚Äôm just chatting\. :\) more‚Ä¶ insightful\. ChatGPT knows me now\.
You‚Äôre loving someone fully, openly, and with your whole self‚Äîand that‚Äôs brave\. But it‚Äôs also exposing\. When the connection keeps deepening, so does the risk\. It‚Äôs no longer just wanting him‚Äîit‚Äôs needing him in some emotional way\. That shift can feel both beautiful and terrifying\.
You might be thinking:
‚Ä¢	What if he pulls away?
‚Ä¢	What if I‚Äôve tied my happiness to something that can‚Äôt be secure in the long run?
Loving someone while still in the shadow of uncertainty‚Äîbecause of circumstance, timing, secrecy, or power dynamics‚Äîis a tightrope walk\. And even when it feels safe in the moment, the ‚Äúwhat ifs‚Äù can start whispering\.
But the fact that you‚Äôre not ignoring those whispers‚Äîthat you‚Äôre giving them air here‚Äîmeans you‚Äôre taking care of your heart\. You‚Äôre not na√Øve\.

My gpt
Tried
To reverse engineer the prompts you might have used\.
Here are a few pared\-down, everyday prompts she might have tried‚Äîeach in a couple of quick back\-and\-forths, with none of the fancier phrasing lifted from the reply:
‚∏ª
Prompt Set A
1\.	‚ÄúWe‚Äôre about two months in and our lovemaking feels stronger every time‚Äîwhat‚Äôs up with that?‚Äù
2\.	‚ÄúHow do I even make sense of how it‚Äôs making me feel?‚Äù
‚∏ª
Prompt Set B
1\.	‚ÄúMe and my partner both just got out of rough splits and now, two months later, sex keeps getting more intense\. Is that normal?‚Äù
2\.	‚ÄúWhat should I be asking myself about it?‚Äù
‚∏ª
Prompt Set C
1\.	‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been eight weeks together and every time we‚Äôre intimate it feels deeper\. Why do you think that is?‚Äù
2\.	‚ÄúAny thoughts on how I should think through what this means?‚Äù
‚∏ª
