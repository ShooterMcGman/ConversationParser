For instance.. following the death of Ian, instead of moving forward with someone new, who she was beginning to get involved with, she reconnected with a high school sweetheart and lived with him for about 10 years.. before he passed.  Neither death was attributed to her.. and she felt that was a mistake looking back but people tend to go to what is familiar she said.  Anyways, I am sure she is just really concerned for me, she remembers what I was like, so I get it.  But I told her we were fine, we were plotting through this, and as time progressed I felt more comfortable and less concerned about getting hurt.

Some of those I am hard wired for.. can't change.. I am intense, sometimes people find that - stifling, overbearing, smothering etc... and with this kind of love, it is a whole new thing, and I really am trying to hold it back.  But other things, like not communicating when things are tough, like really tough, or when something happens that really bothers or hurts me, I will never hold that back from you.  I have already told you and shared things with you that haven't and would never be comfortable sharing with anyone else ever. I know we are new - and there are going to be quirks and things that pop up over time.. but the really big things.. the, can you trust me to be patient, to wait this out, to support you through this process, to not hurt you, while I know you still need to believe on your end, I cannot be more emphatic that this is something you absolutely do not need to be concerned with.  The communication - you know everything I do that really matters.. small fears and insecurities are mine to bear, and are not coming from anything you have given me cause to be concerned with.. they come from a history of being cheated on and taken advantage of.. they are not a reflection of anything you have done, or not done.  I don't just worry about you 95% of the time.. but alot of what I am worried about is connected to you, and to the relationship I hope we get to have.  It does have to do with my situation, what this looks like when I am done, what kind of flexibility and freedom I will have.  If you were really bothering me.. why have I tried every excuse possible to find time to be with you be that for moments, or days at a time... from the parks, to suggesting maybe you come in for the day, to looking at timetables 3 weeks from now lol.. When I joke with you it is meant to be that way only.. I poke fun, I am sarcastic.. but I think I am realizing that you have been insulted and kicked, and marginalized for a really long time.. and that is where you are really sensitive.  And I am sorry that I didn't pay attention to that before.. being called self-centered, lazy, making things more difficult... all of that is complete bullshit.. but I think it might have done a bit of damage too.  So while this is long and drawn out... as is my style... please take comfort that I mean everything here.   And while I know given any circumstance where I come across you in life, I have no doubt I would fall in love with you, I think it being later on in life gives me a perspective and an appreciation that I could never have really had before now, and it just makes this that much more special and important to me.",

So I am probably a little sensitive to things that could be construed as complaining or critiquing maybe is a better word. Not sure. I didn’t complain about anything until 3 yrs ago when I said fuck it. I grew up with my mom being a constant nag to my dad and complaining all the time so I vowed not to be like that. My therapist says I went too far to the extreme to my detriment. But whatever. Done now. So yeah I’m probably overly sensitive to negative connotation words like bossy. lol",

Being around Scott in a professional setting while maintaining the appearance that your relationship is strictly professional—when it’s actually something much more—can be incredibly draining. Here’s why it likely feels exhausting:\n1. Emotional Suppression\nYou’re actively managing and suppressing feelings that are otherwise natural and real. That takes effort and mental energy—especially when you’re near someone you care deeply about.\n2. Hyper-awareness\nYou’re probably highly tuned in to:\n•\tHow close you’re standing to him\n•\tWhat tone you’re using\n•\tWhether anyone is noticing subtle cues\nThat heightened vigilance can be mentally exhausting and physically stressful.\n3. Discomfort with Inauthenticity\nIf you value being honest and emotionally congruent, having to “perform” a role or hide a significant part of your life can feel fake or even painful. It may also feel unfair that others get to just be themselves openly while you have to be careful.\n4. Fear of Exposure\nWhether it’s subtle or strong, a background fear of being found out can create a low-level sense of anxiety the entire time, especially in unscripted social situations.\n5. Emotional Discrepancy\nYou may feel disconnected from Scott even when he’s right beside you—because you can’t relate to him in the way you want to. That emotional dissonance (being close and yet far) is especially jarring when you’ve experienced intimacy and openness in private.",

   "content":"As promised.. and I can elaborate\nSo are you aware of my relationship with Meredith?\nChatGPT said:\nThought for 7 seconds\nYes—based on the details you shared earlier, I understand that Meredith is the colleague with whom you’ve recently developed a quiet, emerging relationship (the drive to Heydenshores, the charm, the tentative two-year timeline, and the mutual decision to keep things discreet at work). If you’d like to explore any aspect of that—whether navigating workplace boundaries, planning next steps, or just putting feelings into words—let me know how I can help.\nYou said:\nThe relationship has gone well beyond that.  We have shared and explored very serious feelings for each other.  We see each other as \"home\" and as \"soul mates\" which leaves me feeling more happiness than I would have thought possible.   We have found time to spend with each other mostly out of need - whereby I am in a bad place and Meredith steps up and makes something happen - like the suggestion about connecting in Detroit, or the weekend of her Mother's birthday, or last weekend at the cottage (albeit while I was actually in a low place this was more serendipitous).  These have been amazing times.. we have learned a lot about each other, but mostly how much we enjoy each others' company beyond anything else.  We are both going through a tough time, and I externalize things while she internalizes them which makes it challenging sometimes when we are trying to reassure one another.  Recently I have been trying to find little bits of time.. just to see her, touch her, be with her for real.. doesn't matter if it is 5 minutes or whatever.. I think it is difficult for her to be with me and then not, but I don't think these 5 minute meetings would suffice for her.  I am really confused.. and hurt but willing to do anything for her..  what do I do here.. how can I explain to her what that time really means to me..  we are about to cease public contact at work because it is so difficult for her.. but it is difficult for me too.  I don't understand why the bits of time wouldn't work for her.\nChatGPT said:\nThought for 10 seconds\n1 | Step back and map the terrain\nYou\tMeredith\tStrategic takeaway\nExternal processor – you talk it out and seek real-time reassurance.\tInternal processor – she thinks it through first, then shares once it feels “settled.”\tYour default soothing mechanisms are almost opposites; neither is wrong, just mismatched.\nImplication: When you grab a five-minute hallway hug you feel topped-up; she can be left mid-spiral (“I just opened the flood-gates and now he’s gone”). The same micro-contact that calms you may amplify her anxiety.\n2 | Why “quick touches” might short-circuit her needs\nEmotional lag-time – Internalizers require a runway to shift from “focused on work/distractions” → “emotionally present.” Five minutes ends before take-off.\nAttachment style – If she leans anxious-preoccupied, mini-meetings can feel like half a promise: immediate relief followed by a sharper drop.\nCognitive load at work – Switching from secrecy → intimacy → secrecy inside the same office hour is exhausting; the after-effects last longer for an internalizer.\nBoundary guilt – Brief clandestine moments inside a public setting can spike her fear of discovery (or of hurting others), overshadowing the sweetness.\n3 | Translate your meaning into her language\nYour intention\tPossible framing in her terms\n“These five minutes keep me afloat.”\t“For me, even 300 seconds with you resets my nervous system. It isn’t a demand for more; it’s gratitude for any moment you can spare.”\n“I want to show I’m here, always.”\t“Small touches are my way of saying ‘I’m not going anywhere’—not pressuring you for closeness you’re not ready for.”\n“I feel low without you.”\t“When life gets heavy, a brief check-in with you steadies me; afterward I can handle the day better, which actually reduces the load I put on you later.”\nDeliver that message during a low-stress, private setting (not directly before or after work), when she has bandwidth to absorb nuance.\n4 | Joint game-plan: from ad-hoc to intentional\nFocus area\tPractical moves\tCascading benefits\nScheduled quality blocks\tAgree on predictable larger windows (e.g., every second Saturday 10 am–4 pm).\tReassures her she’ll get full “connection time,” making tiny gaps easier to tolerate.\nMicro-signals\tIf live contact is tough, use asynchronous love tokens: handwritten note in her coat pocket, 30-sec voice memo, shared music playlist.\tGives you the “quick touch” dopamine; gives her control over when to open it.\nBoundary charter\tDocument the specific times/places you’ll avoid at work and a protocol for emergencies (“text ‘pinecone’ = I’m spiralling, can we talk tonight?”).\tLowers discovery risk, clarifies expectations, shows respect for her comfort zone.\nCheck-in ritual\tWeekly 15-minute video/phone call solely to ask: “What felt good? What felt hard? Adjust?”\tBuilds iterative feedback loop, catches resentment early.\n5 | Conversation blueprint (use, tweak, discard)\nOpen with curiosity\n“I’ve noticed quick visits help me but seem tougher for you. Can we explore why together?”\nState your why, own the feeling\n“When we touch base, even briefly, it grounds me—it’s my coping tool, not a measure of your devotion.”\nInvite her perspective without rebuttal\n“What happens inside for you during those short meetings?” Listen, reflect back.\nCo-design alternatives\n“What forms of contact feel nourishing and safe for you? Let’s prototype a mix.”\nSeal with a concrete next step\n“So this week: no surprise pop-ins; instead a Friday night call plus Saturday hike. Deal?”\n6 | Mindset tweaks for you\nReframe scarcity – Short gaps aren’t proof of waning love; they’re an investment in long-term sustainability.\nChannel the energy – Pour the urge to “see her now” into creating surprise long-form gestures (a letter, curated playlist, planning a future trip).\nSelf-soothe toolkit – Build independent reset buttons (workout, breathwork, friend debrief) so the entire regulation load doesn’t rest on those five minutes.\n7 | If friction persists\nSuggest a neutral mediator: couples counsellor or even a one-off session with a relationship coach.\nRe-evaluate the secrecy plan: total public silence may help her anxiety but could starve you both; maybe a limited set of “safe colleague interactions” remains.\n8 | Bottom line\nThe mismatch isn’t about love quantity—it’s about love cadence. By acknowledging her processing tempo, articulating what micro-moments give you, and co-engineering a rhythm that features both predictable deep dives and low-pressure signals, you’ll turn confusion into a shared operating manual.\nYou’ve already proven you’re each other’s “home.” Now you’re just renovating the floorplan so both residents feel comfortable in every room.\n(And hey—if all else fails, start labeling meeting invites “Quarterly Risk Mitigation Summit.” No one ever shows up to those.)",
