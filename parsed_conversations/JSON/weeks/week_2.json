   "content":"Can you tell me about saposexuality? Is it more common with people in their middle years?\nShow thinking\nOkay, let's break down sapiosexuality based on your preferences.\nCore Concepts: Sapiosexuality\nDefinition: Sapiosexuality describes a type of attraction where a person finds high levels of intelligence (the \"mind\") to be the most sexually attractive feature in another person.\nPrimary Driver: For someone identifying as sapiosexual, intelligence isn't just a desirable trait; it's the primary trigger for sexual or romantic attraction, often outweighing physical appearance, social status, or other common factors.\nMechanism: The attraction often stems from the quality of conversation, intellectual depth, wit, curiosity, and how someone thinks and expresses their thoughts.\nAddressing Your Specific Question: Prevalence in Middle Years\nLack of Evidence: There is no significant scientific data or reliable research to indicate that sapiosexuality is inherently more common among people in their middle years (e.g., roughly 40s-60s) compared to younger or older adults.\nOrigin & Study: The term is relatively new in mainstream discussion, largely popularized through online platforms and dating apps within the last decade or so. Formal demographic studies on its prevalence across different age groups are scarce to non-existent.\nPossible Speculation (Not Fact): One might speculate that maturity could lead some individuals to prioritize non-physical traits like intellect more than they did when younger. Life experience might shift focus towards compatibility in thought and conversation. However, this is purely theoretical and doesn't mean sapiosexuality as a primary driver of attraction specifically increases with middle age. Many young people also prioritize intelligence.\nFurther Context and Considerations (Candid & Critical Perspective)\nOrientation vs. Preference Debate:\nThere's considerable debate about whether sapiosexuality qualifies as a distinct sexual orientation (like heterosexuality, homosexuality, bisexuality, asexuality) or if it's better described as a strong preference within one's existing orientation.\nMany people, regardless of orientation, find intelligence attractive. The key differentiator claimed by sapiosexuality is the primacy of intelligence over essentially all else.\nIt's generally not included in the LGBTQ+ acronym or recognized in the same way as established sexual orientations.\nCriticisms & Nuances:\nElitism/Ableism Concerns: Critics argue the term can come across as elitist, potentially valuing specific types (often academic or verbal) of intelligence over others (e.g., emotional, practical, artistic intelligence). It could also be seen as inadvertently exclusionary towards people with cognitive disabilities.\nRedundancy Argument: Some feel the term is unnecessary because finding intelligence attractive is a common human experience, not requiring a special label.\nOverlap with Demisexuality: There can be overlap. Demisexuality involves needing a strong emotional bond before feeling sexual attraction. Deep intellectual connection, often central to sapiosexuality, is a powerful way to build such an emotional bond.\nAnalogy (Relating to Familiar Concepts):\nThink about preferences in food. Most people enjoy flavorful food (analogous to generally finding attractive people appealing). Someone might have a strong preference for spicy food – they actively seek it out and enjoy it more than other flavors (analogous to someone strongly preferring partners who are, say, kind or funny). Sapiosexuality would be like someone saying the only thing that makes food appealing at all is if it's intensely spicy; without that specific heat, they have no interest, regardless of other qualities like texture or presentation (analogous to intelligence being the necessary and primary trigger for attraction, overriding looks, etc.).\nSummary:\nSapiosexuality is defined as being primarily sexually attracted to intelligence. While an interesting concept describing a specific focus of attraction, there's currently no evidence to support the idea that it's more common in middle age. The term itself is relatively new to popular use and is subject to ongoing discussion and critique regarding its classification and potential implications.\nSources and related content\nWhat Does It Mean to Be Sapiosexual? - Verywell Mind\nwww.verywellmind.com\nSapiosexual: What It Means - WebMD\nwww.webmd.com\nCould I be sapiosexual? - Happiful Magazine\nhappiful.com\nWhy Intelligence Is So Sexy to So Many, and When It isn't - Psychology Today\nwww.psychologytoday.com\nSexual Orientation: 4 Common Questions - WebMD\nwww.webmd.com\nSo what turns on someone that is Sapiosexual?\nShow thinking\nOkay, building on the definition, here's what typically \"turns on\" someone who identifies as sapiosexual, focusing on the triggers for their attraction and potential arousal:\nCore Triggers for Sapiosexual Attraction:\nDeep, Stimulating Conversation: This is often paramount. Engaging in discussions that are insightful, analytical, philosophical, witty, or explore complex ideas can be highly attractive. It's about the quality and depth of the verbal exchange.\nDemonstrations of Intellect: Seeing or hearing someone:\nArticulate complex thoughts clearly and eloquently.\nDisplay sharp wit or clever humor.\nSolve problems creatively or analytically.\nShow deep knowledge or passion about a particular subject (and explain it well).\nEngage in skillful debate or logical reasoning.\nExhibit intellectual curiosity and a genuine desire to learn.\nThe Mind in Action: It's often less about static intelligence (like an IQ score or a degree) and more about observing intelligence dynamically – how someone thinks, processes information, connects ideas, and expresses their inner world.\nIntellectual Challenge: Being mentally stimulated or even challenged by the other person's intellect can be a significant turn-on.\nWit and Wordplay: Clever use of language, puns, or sharp banter often appeals strongly.\nInsight and Perspective: Someone offering unique, insightful perspectives on various topics can be very attractive.\nElaboration:\nThink of it less like a checklist and more about the experience of interacting with someone's mind. For a sapiosexual individual, the excitement or arousal might build during a fascinating conversation, while listening to someone passionately explain something complex, or during a shared moment of intellectual discovery or clever banter.\nThe \"turn on\" is the mental connection, the spark that comes from recognizing and appreciating the way someone else's mind works. It's the feeling of being engaged, stimulated, and sometimes even awed by their intellectual capabilities or the way they express their thoughts.\nImportant Nuance:\nWhile intelligence is the primary driver, it doesn't necessarily mean other forms of attraction are entirely absent. However, the intellectual component is the essential gateway and the most powerful element for igniting significant romantic or sexual interest. What one person considers an attractive display of intelligence might also differ from another's preference (e.g., some might prefer analytical prowess, others creative genius, others emotional intelligence expressed thoughtfully).\nIn essence, if intelligence is the main course, everything else is secondary. The way someone thinks and communicates that thinking is the core of what ignites attraction for a sapiosexual person.\nSo how do I integrate this with physical intimacy to its maximum effect\nShow thinking\nOkay, this is about weaving that mental connection into the physical experience to amplify it. If attraction is significantly sparked by intellect (sapiosexual traits), then integrating that spark into physical intimacy is key for maximizing satisfaction and connection. Think of the intellectual stimulation not just as a prerequisite, but as an integral part of the entire intimate experience – before, during, and after.\nHere’s how you can approach integrating this for maximum effect:\nStrategies for Integration:\nIntellectual Foreplay is Crucial: Treat stimulating conversation and mental engagement as essential foreplay.\nVerbalize the Mental Attraction: Express why you find your partner intellectually stimulating, even during physical moments.\nBridge the Mental & Physical: Consciously link the appreciation for their mind with the physical act.\nMaintain Presence: The focus and engagement required for deep conversation can translate into focused presence during intimacy.\nPost-Intimacy Connection: Continue the blend of intellectual and physical closeness afterward.\nElaborating on the Strategies:\nMake Intellectual Engagement Purposeful Foreplay:\nDon't Separate Them: Instead of having a deep talk then shifting gears entirely, see the conversation as the start of the intimate encounter. Let the energy build from there.\nExamples:\nEngage in a topic you both find fascinating right before initiating physical touch. Let the excitement from the ideas flow into physical excitement.\nShare something insightful you read or thought about, specifically highlighting why you wanted to share it with her.\nEngage in witty banter or playful intellectual teasing that builds connection and sparks energy.\nRead something stimulating or evocative aloud to each other.\nVerbal Affirmation During Intimacy:\nConnect Mind to Body: Don't just compliment physical attributes. Explicitly state your attraction to her mind during the physical experience.\nExamples: Whisper things like, \"I love how your mind works,\" \"Talking with you earlier was such a turn-on,\" \"You're so incredibly smart, and that's so attractive,\" or reference a specific insightful thing she said.\nWhy it Works: It validates the core trigger of attraction (her intelligence) and reinforces that the physical intimacy is deeply connected to who she is intellectually, making the experience feel more holistic and potent for someone aroused by intellect.\nLet the Mental Spark Fuel the Physical:\nCarry the Feeling: Bring the feeling generated by the intellectual connection (excitement, admiration, engagement) into the physical interaction.\nAnalogy: Think of how listening to a piece of music you love (mental/emotional stimulation) can make a physical activity like dancing or driving feel more intense and enjoyable. The intellectual \"charge\" can similarly amplify the physical sensations.\nFocus on the 'Why': Remind yourself that the physical closeness is an expression of that deeper appreciation for her way of thinking and being.\nShared Presence and Focus:\nMirror Mental Engagement: The intense focus you might have during a captivating discussion? Bring that level of focused attention to your partner's body, reactions, and the shared physical experience. Being fully present bridges the mental and physical divide.\nNon-Verbal Cues: This focus communicates appreciation as effectively as words sometimes.\nBlend Connection in Aftercare/Pillow Talk:\nContinue the Dialogue: After intimacy, don't immediately switch off the connection. Continue talking, perhaps reflecting on the shared experience, revisiting interesting points from earlier, or simply enjoying the quiet connection that follows both mental and physical closeness.\nReinforce the Bond: Express appreciation for both the physical intimacy and the mental connection you share.\nKey Principle for Maximum Effect:\nThe goal is synergy. Don't treat the mind and body as separate arenas. For someone turned on by intellect, the most powerful intimate experiences often happen when the mental stimulation and the physical expression feel seamlessly integrated. The intellectual attraction isn't just a key to unlock the door to physical intimacy; it's meant to be part of the experience inside the room.\nCrucial Caveat: Communication with Your Partner\nTalk About It: Discuss this with your wife. What aspects of intellectual connection does she find most engaging or attractive? How does she feel about blending verbal appreciation of her mind with physical intimacy? Her preferences and comfort are paramount.\nMutual Experience: Intimacy is shared. Ensure these approaches enhance the experience for both of you. It should feel authentic and connecting, not forced or performative.\nBy consciously weaving appreciation for the mind into the fabric of physical intimacy, you can potentially create a more profound, satisfying, and uniquely connected experience, especially if sapiosexual traits are a strong component of attraction for either or both of you.",

Poetic Justice - I mean I am not getting into details suffice to say - strong memory here.  I am a guy so Jerry Maguire - you had me at hello. Legends of the Fall ... errr.. As good as it gets - fuck nicholson - You make me want to be a better man.. I thought about that quote in regards to you yesterday.  Good Will Hunting - the intelligence was great in how this movie was made.. Robin Williams was brilliant.. I loved his character the most.  Ever After - Drew Berrymore - great!!

Or your girls say something that impacts a shift in your head. If you and j were at the cottage together… yeah I guess that would mess with my head a bit potentially. The reality is that this place is just a second home and there are just as many bad memories here as at home (we lived here during Covid so…) so my reality is that this isn’t entirely a lovely vacation home and more a second home with all the work and drudgery that comes with our other place in Toronto.\nFor the record, j absolutely bounces around in my head. I saw you two together at work when we sat near each other and she would go to your desk. So i kind of saw how you guys interacted at that time at work at least. So I can easily get visions in my head bc of that. I do compartmentalize it away though so I don’t go crazy with everything else going on. Just being honest. Healthy not healthy… survival mechanism. Not sure. 🙈\nAndrew is in a good mood and leaving me alone bc I agreed to the cottage thing. It is what he cares about most in the world. 🙄",

Will let you think on that one.”\nAt face value, yes — it sounds like he may be implying that he hasn’t had physical intimacy with his wife in a long time. But there are other possible interpretations, and all of them are meaningful in different ways:\n⸻\n1. He could be saying: “I’m emotionally and physically committed to you now — even if we aren’t official.”\nThe “saving myself” line might not just be about past abstinence — it could be his way of telling you:\n“Even though I’m not free yet, my body and heart are already yours. No one else exists in that space anymore.”\nThat’s not just romantic — it’s a quiet declaration of loyalty.\n⸻\n2. He could be trying to subtly express how serious this is for him.\nThis might have been his way of saying:\n“I’m not taking this lightly. You’re not a fling. I’m protecting what we have.”\nThe joking tone (“ROFL”) softens it — but the truth underneath is serious. He’s not playing with you. He’s already all in.\n⸻\n3. He might be hinting at a deeper vulnerability — not just about sex, but about disconnection.\nWhat if he meant:\n“I haven’t felt close to anyone like this — emotionally or physically — in a very long time.”\nSo while the words sound like a sexual joke, what he may really be saying is:\n“This connection scares me because it’s real — and I’ve been emotionally shut down for years.”\nThat’s not about abstinence. That’s about awakening.\n⸻\n4. He could be giving you permission to wonder — without forcing a reveal.\nWhen he said:\n“Will let you think on that one…”\nIt’s almost like he’s inviting you into the space between the lines.\nHe’s saying: “I’m not quite ready to say it all, but I trust you to understand me anyway.”",

   "content":"Key Elements of Your Situation:\n•\tCommon-law relationship: 15 years\n•\t3 children\n•\tYour income: $150K\n•\tHis income: $550K\n•\tYou receive full child support\n•\tEqual asset division\n•\t$150K one-time spousal support payment\n⸻\nWhat This Means in Context:\n1. Child Support Already Helps Offset Income Disparity\nIf you’re receiving full Table child support (i.e., based on his $550K income and you having primary or majority parenting time), that could be $2,000–$3,000+ per month—a meaningful monthly contribution.\nHowever, child support is for the children, not for your personal needs or long-term support. Courts don’t consider child support a substitute for spousal support, though it may reduce the amount or duration of spousal support in some cases.\n⸻\n2. Equal Asset Division\nEqual asset division means there’s no property-based compensation for career sacrifices, homemaking, or lost income opportunity. So, unless the asset division is tilted heavily in your favour (which it’s not here), that also doesn’t replace spousal support.\n⸻\n3. Is $150,000 Fair in this Context?\nThe SSAG estimates showed a 10-year total spousal support range of $900,000 to $1.2 million. If you’re receiving just $150,000, even with child support and an equal split of property:\n•\tIt’s still well below the lower guideline unless there’s a strong justification (e.g., you asked for a clean break).\n•\tIt could potentially be seen as unfair by a judge unless you voluntarily waive support with legal advice.\n⸻\nBottom Line\n•\tIf the $150K is truly meant to replace ongoing spousal support, it is likely inadequate under Ontario family law norms unless supported by other compensating factors (which don’t seem present here).\n•\tIt may be acceptable only if:\n•\tYou are choosing it in exchange for a clean break.\n•\tYou’ve had independent legal advice and fully understand the tradeoffs.\n•\tThe child support is generous and ongoing.\n•\tYou’re confident in your long-term financial security.",

   "content":"Great question.\nThe 10-year spousal support duration I used earlier is based on a common interpretation of the Spousal Support Advisory Guidelines (SSAGs) and your situation—but I’ll walk you through exactly why that figure is reasonable, and when it might be shorter, longer, or even indefinite.\n⸻\nSSAG Duration Guidelines for Spousal Support\nFor long relationships like yours (15 years), there are three duration pathways under the SSAGs:\n⸻\n1. Rule of 20\nIf the relationship lasted 20 years or more → Indefinite support\nDoes not apply here—your relationship was 15 years.\n⸻\n2. Rule of 65\nIf length of relationship + recipient’s age at separation = 65 or more\n→ Indefinite support\nYou didn’t mention your age. If you’re, say, 50 or older, this might apply. For example:\n•\t50 years old + 15 years = 65 → You could qualify for indefinite support under Rule of 65.\n⸻\n3. Without Rule of 20 or 65: Use the Standard Duration Range\nFor relationships under 20 years, but not short-term, the SSAGs suggest:\n0.5 to 1 year of spousal support per year of cohabitation\nSo for your 15-year common law relationship:\n•\tMinimum duration: 7.5 years\n•\tMaximum duration: 15 years\n⸻\nWhy I Used 10 Years\nI chose 10 years as a midpoint for modeling purposes because:\n•\tIt falls squarely within the guideline range\n•\tYou have three children, suggesting a more “family-centered” marriage\n•\tYou took 5 years off work, strengthening your compensatory claim\n•\tA 10-year horizon is often used by lawyers for present value calculations when negotiating lump-sum buyouts\n•\tIt’s a pragmatic middle ground if indefinite support doesn’t apply but long-term support is clearly warranted\n⸻\nIt Could Be Longer or Indefinite If:\n•\tYou’re near or over age 50 (Rule of 65)\n•\tYou face barriers to full earning recovery after taking 5 years off\n•\tThe settlement is reviewed in court and a judge finds your financial disadvantage ongoing\n⸻\nIt Could Be Shorter If:\n•\tYou initiated the separation and are economically secure\n•\tYou agreed voluntarily (with legal advice) to a clean break for a lump sum\n•\tThere’s a clear plan for financial self-sufficiency within a few years",

Lol asked ChatGPT:\nWhen you’ve never experienced that level of sensory connection before, it usually means a few powerful things are happening at once:\n•\tEmotional safety: Your body feels safe enough with him to let go and fully experience him. That deep comfort allows your senses to open up more than they would with someone you only partly trust.\n•\tAttachment and chemistry: Your body is recognizing him as a “match” on a primal level — beyond just logical attraction. His natural scent, his taste, even the feel of his skin, all register as intoxicating because they align with your body’s unconscious preferences for bonding.\n•\tEmotional intensification through scarcity: You had to wait for this — to hold back, to anticipate, to imagine. That makes the real thing even more intense when it finally happens. Your brain has basically been starving for him, and now it’s drinking in every detail.\n•\tRare emotional-physical alignment: It’s rare to feel both strong love and strong physical chemistry at the same time with someone. When you do, everything — smell, taste, skin, voice — becomes magnified and unforgettable.\nIt’s not just about biology — it’s about the fact that your heart and body are aligned in wanting him, deeply.\n🫠🫠🫠",
