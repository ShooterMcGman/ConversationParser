So it is all kind of unsettling and new to me\. Andrew was used to it but when we got together even I was very fit\. Anyway it is an odd one for me and definitely an insecurity\. Especially after 3 c sections\. Even when I get fit and work out etc etc etc I have a c section shelf\. I try not to focus on all that crap but it definitely bothers me when like lights are shone on it\.

Below is a structured, step\-by\-step ‚Äúisochrone‚Äù \(drive\-time\) model for identifying increasingly distant meeting spots from 500 Consumers Drive, Toronto, with a focus on quiet, private, and naturally romantic settings\. We‚Äôll sketch out the methodology first, then populate three concentric ‚Äúrings‚Äù \(5\-, 10\-, and 15\-minute drive times\) while biasing away from westward options\.
‚∏ª
1\. Methodology: Building Your Drive\-Time Isochrones
1\.	Pick your drive\-time thresholds\.
‚Ä¢	Ring 1: ~5 minutes
‚Ä¢	Ring 2: ~10 minutes
‚Ä¢	Ring 3: ~15 minutes
2\.	Use an isochrone tool \(e\.g\., Google Maps Platform, Mapbox Isochrone API\) centered at 500 Consumers Dr to generate these polygons\.
‚Ä¢	Filter out western arcs if you want to minimize west\-ward travel\.
‚Ä¢	Export the geojson for each ring\.
3\.	Overlay parks/natural areas\.
‚Ä¢	Import the isochrone polygons into a GIS or even Google My Maps\.
‚Ä¢	Layer on Toronto parks, ravines, gardens data\.
4\.	Score candidate spots by:
‚Ä¢	Privacy: smaller parks or off\-path trails
‚Ä¢	Romance f\.\.\. \[truncated\]

When you‚Äôre feeling even beyond overwhelmed, it can move into what psychologists sometimes call:
‚Ä¢	Emotional flooding ‚Äì when your nervous system is overloaded and you feel unable to process or respond clearly\. It can come with tears, numbness, irritability, or even a shutdown feeling\.
‚Ä¢	Dysregulation ‚Äì when your emotions are so heightened that your mind and body can‚Äôt stay balanced\. It‚Äôs like your inner system is short\-circuiting\.
‚Ä¢	Overcapacity ‚Äì not a clinical term, but a deeply real one\. It means your mental, emotional, and physical bandwidth has been maxed out, and even small things feel enormous\.
‚Ä¢	Disintegration ‚Äì the opposite of feeling integrated or whole\. It‚Äôs when your usual coping tools and sense of self feel like they‚Äôre coming apart, even if temporarily\.
‚Ä¢	Collapse ‚Äì when the system doesn‚Äôt fight or flee anymore‚Äîit just drops\. You may feel flat, hopeless, or disconnected\.
These states are often signs that your body and heart are begging for gentleness, not more pressure to\.\.\. \[truncated\]

### 919. msg_8649

**You** - 2025-05-05T19:11:19

**Meredith Lamb \(\+14169386001\)** - 2025-05-05T19:15:56

It is an odd feeling to miss something so much that we only really had for 4 days ‚Ä¶ and not even full time lol


---

### 925. msg_8655

**You** - 2025-05-05T19:16:39

but see that isn't just it\.\. even absent that time\.\. I would still be frustrated and lonely, and achy\.\. even if all we had was the back of the car that first time\.


---

### 926. msg_8656

**You** - 2025-05-05T19:16:46

that was enough\.\.


---

### 927. msg_8657

**You** - 2025-05-05T19:17:18

I was in love before the car\.\. after I was convinced something different was going on\.


---

### 928. msg_8658

**You** - 2025-05-05T19:17:59

so while it makes it harder probably because there was something very tangible and now we cannot have any of it\.\. I sitll would have felt incomplete\.


---

### 929. msg_8659

**Meredith Lamb \(\+14169386001\)** - 2025-05-05T19:20:26

**You** - 2025-05-05T19:24:04

anyhow let's not talk about the weekend anymore\.\. magical and rainbows and unicorns\.\. lol and real as hell and as perfect as I could expect it to be\.\. and it reflects what can be\.\. but honestly the more I think about it the more everything sucks\.


---

### 937. msg_8667

**Meredith Lamb \(\+14169386001\)** - 2025-05-05T19:25:00

### 948. msg_8678

**You** - 2025-05-05T19:27:00

all the emotion and stuff and urgency and connection etc\.\. wouldn't be the same


---

### 949. msg_8679

**You** - 2025-05-05T19:27:09

oh I still think we would have gotten to the same place


---

### 951. msg_8681

**Meredith Lamb \(\+14169386001\)** - 2025-05-05T19:27:31

I honestly think this was my fault\. If I never told you about the text that day on our one on one I don‚Äôt see this happening


---

### 952. msg_8682

I bet\.\.


---

### 959. msg_8689

Okie\. And listen, I know you don‚Äôt fully know how I deal with stress yet \(maybe not sure\) but my nervous system is completely shot right now\. With separation, finding a new place to live, worrying about financials, my kids, my mom‚Äôs health, all the secrecy and then work \(I haven‚Äôt led a team that long\) etc etc etc\. worried about you at times \(YESTERDAY\), our reporting relationship ‚Ä¶ etc etc ‚Ä¶my insides are completely shot right now\. I‚Äôm like a burnt vape\. Time with you would definitely help but ‚Ä¶\.\. I know\. But I am not well despite what outward appearances may show\. But this will pass and I know after telling girls tonight it will help a bit while also making it harder at the same time\.

It‚Äôs not really that constant anymore but I could tell he wanted to say that last night\.

Here is a direct side\-by\-side comparison of Morgan Wallen and Kane Brown, focused on the key dimensions of their popularity, including sexual appeal, musical identity, public image, and cultural impact:
‚∏ª
Morgan Wallen vs\. Kane Brown: Popularity Factors Comparison
Dimension	Morgan Wallen	Kane Brown
Sexual Appeal	Strong and overt; tied to his ‚Äúbad boy‚Äù persona, rugged looks, and rebellious attitude\.	Present but softer; more tied to romantic vulnerability, tattoos, and devoted family man\.
Public Persona	Rebellious, raw, emotionally flawed; exudes a mix of charm and controversy\.	Wholesome, grounded, family\-oriented; perceived as humble and emotionally supportive\.
Musical Style	Traditional country with rock and Southern influences; rough\-edged vocals and themes\.	Country\-pop\-R&B hybrid; smoother vocals, crossover production, modern emotional themes\.
Emotional Themes	Heartbreak, drinking, defiance, masculinity, regret\.	Love, family, perseverance, racial identity, self\-worth\.
Fanbase Drivers	\.\.\. \[truncated\]
