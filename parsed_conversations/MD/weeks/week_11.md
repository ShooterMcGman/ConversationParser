I wanted to say again appreciated what you said but I am a bit of bull in a china shop atm no flattery necessary, I am just trying to figure ‚Äúthis‚Äù all out again, and it feels like the first time all over\.  Btw the look of shock on my face yesterday was at how beautiful you were in that moment and how I felt like you are so absolutely out of my league lol‚Ä¶ was like a reaction I couldn‚Äôt control\.\. I am sure it will happen again lol\.   Contrary
To what you might think this hasn‚Äôt been me in 25 years and I am not lying\.\. but I do want to know what makes you happy\.\. maybe we can talk about that on this trip coming up\.\.  maybe you could learn to appreciate some of my OCD qualities??

Since Jessica is also a clergy person, she will be wearing a robe and stole\.
In the Episcopal Church, the ordination of a priest is a big deal and some people highlight the significance of that in their attire\. Other people don‚Äôt give a shit and wear whatever\.
However, I would certainly never want you to feel embarrassed because you felt underdressed\. Based on what I know about you, I think you would feel most comfortable with khakis and a button\-down shirt‚Ä¶ Throw on a jacket if you like Jessica will wear a dress\. I‚Äôm so Meredith may want to take this chance to have a little fun with what she wears Keeping in mind that we‚Äôre going to church and not the club\.ü§£
