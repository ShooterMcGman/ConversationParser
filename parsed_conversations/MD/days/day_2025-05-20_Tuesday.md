*üí¨ Reply*

**052.** `14:22` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

I mean, I‚Äôm not actually expecting anything for years in that regard\. It would be nice but‚Ä¶\.\. complicated\.


**053.** `14:27` **You**

I know\.\. if it is many many years the\. That makes my decision easy\.


**054.** `14:28` **You**

We don‚Äôt even need to have the chat üëç


**055.** `14:28` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

**056.** `14:32` **You**

>
Yeah totally agree\.

*üí¨ Reply*

**057.** `14:52` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Omg I can‚Äôt even explain the words spewing out of his mouth today\. ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶\.


**058.** `14:53` **You**

Gah I wish he would just stop fighting and work towards a solution\.


**059.** `14:53` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

He‚Äôs all mad that the separation agreement won‚Äôt include anything I have to do for him:


**060.** `14:53` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

The separation agreement will include things that I need to do for you over the next 8 years \- essentially pay child support and spousal support\.  And it will have mutual obligations about sharing the kids\.  It will not have any things you need to do for me\.   Which is just the way it is\.  So you won‚Äôt need to resent me or feel unappreciated by me any more, which will be helpful I hope\.


**061.** `14:54` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

I told you \- he is very transactional


**062.** `14:55` **You**

Yeah that seems kind of fecked up\.\. here I am offering to help j with any ongoing documentation and shit for the home anyways\.\.


**063.** `14:55` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

First time he has ever said he appreciates something from me\. I‚Äôm kind of shell shocked tbh\.

**066.** `15:00` **You**

**067.** `15:01` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

I get the ‚Äúplease stop taking‚Ä¶ blahblahblah‚Äù all the time now


**068.** `15:01` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

I told him he had to stop saying that


**069.** `15:01` **You**

Well like you said you were just clarifying and correcting


**070.** `17:08` **You**

Have to Remeber where I can say what


**071.** `17:09` **You**

**073.** `17:13` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

**074.** `17:14` **You**

**077.** `17:46` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Reaction: ‚ù§Ô∏è from Scott Hicks
Just don‚Äôt get in your head about all the ‚Äúbe cautious‚Äù advice\. You are everything to me and have no reason for caution\.


**078.** `18:07` **You**

I am not slowing mer\.


**079.** `18:07` **You**

But I am hanging out with cm after hours\. üòù


**080.** `18:11` **You**

Reaction: ‚ù§Ô∏è from Meredith Lamb
But in all seriousness I am all in, I already told you\.\. I am so in love with every aspect of you\.  I have never fallen in love like this and won‚Äôt again\.\. I know officially living together is a ways off but spending more regular evenings or let‚Äôs just say time in general with each other might not be that far away\.\. and I think that is what I am going to focus on\.  And getting whatever reasonable chance to spend minutes with you wherever I can because it all means something to me\.


**081.** `18:13` **You**

I think it is because I have fallen in like with you as much as I have fallen in love with you\.  Which might sound funny but I think it is one of those things that you need for it to be truly real and lasting\.


**082.** `18:20` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Yeah I get it\. Ok, just didn‚Äôt want the caution caution ‚ö†Ô∏è alerts to get to you\. Lol


**083.** `18:21` **You**

No no I am already past the point of no return I think I was months ago to be honest\.\. even before Detroit\.


**084.** `18:23` **You**

Reaction: ‚ù§Ô∏è from Meredith Lamb
This was like ‚Äúyou had me at hello‚Äù lol‚Ä¶ ü•∞


**085.** `18:30` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Ditto\. So same page still\. Phew


**086.** `18:33` **You**

Yeah mer \-  nothing is going to change I am not
Looking backwards to relive old flings or explore what could have been or any shit like that\.\. I am not looking sideways because in either case no one can come close to what I believe we have\.  And I am assuming we are on the same page on everything honestly so even though I have irrational fears sometimes I try not to let it bother me too much\.


**087.** `18:36` **You**

I am also sorry if sharing what dev said caused you to worry‚Ä¶ you have enough going on\.


**088.** `18:38` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Didn‚Äôt worry per se üòâ


**089.** `18:54` **You**

Per se lol


**090.** `18:54` **You**

**091.** `18:55` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

**092.** `18:55` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Gah non stop crap to do


**093.** `18:55` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Now I‚Äôm lying down for an hour until volleyball pick up lol


**094.** `18:55` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Anyway I maybe did worry a bit but feel better now\.


**095.** `18:56` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

I wasn‚Äôt sure how much you would listen to the caution speakers\. üôÉ


**096.** `18:56` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

If it might change anything or not


**097.** `19:23` **You**

No like I said no listening\.\. Just going to try trusting and leaning on each other to get through this to what is next\.


**098.** `19:48` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Shortest nap ever :\(


**099.** `19:49` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

**106.** `20:34` **You**

But we are getting closer to me just signing off\.\. I have been trying to connect and find ways\.\. but I mean she is 18 and she literally won‚Äôt stop fighting about everything including still wanting to live here and go to university but she actually wants to force the issue and live with me and maddie who hates her\.\. like it is impossible\. J was going to fly her up to see her friends and I am saying no now because she might refuse to get in the return flight back\.


**107.** `20:36` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

No words‚Ä¶\. It sounds impossible but hopefully she relents eventually


**108.** `20:37` **You**

I don‚Äôt think she will she has created all of these scenarios\.\.  I cannot even explain it to try to justify what she wants and none of them make sense
