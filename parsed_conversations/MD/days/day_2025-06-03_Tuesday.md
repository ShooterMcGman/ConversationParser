**142.** `19:00` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

He feels bad for me because you are on fire?


**143.** `19:01` **You**

Yep it was great\.\. we went way over time\.\. he didn't seem to care\.\. I was just telling stories\.\. pretty sure I hooked him in\.


**144.** `19:01` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

**145.** `19:01` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

I don‚Äôt think you need FIXING\.


**151.** `19:03` **You**

yes I do\.\. I will be far better after


**152.** `19:03` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

It is more just talking and getting some feedback


**153.** `19:03` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Perspective from someone else


**154.** `19:03` **You**

Less dependent\.\. more flexible\.\. less plan focused\.\.


**155.** `19:04` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Is being plan focused a bad thing?


**156.** `19:04` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Some ppl like to plan

**158.** `19:05` **You**

words\.\.


**159.** `19:05` **You**

I have added this to my list of things to accomplish \- right next to the picture of Henry Caville coming out of the ocean\.


**160.** `19:05` **You**

this is what you want


**161.** `19:05` **You**

this is Open\.\.


**162.** `19:06` **You**

and I want to do this üòä


**163.** `19:08` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Read the words


**164.** `19:08` **You**

I think future discussions are going to help me out here\.


**165.** `19:08` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Never really read them before


**166.** `19:08` **You**

I mean I liked it when I first listened to it\.\. but then the words meant something\.\. more recently\.


**167.** `19:08` **You**

I felt it was apt\.\.


**168.** `19:09` **You**

anyhow even if that doesn't align up with your vision of Open\.\. there has to be enough crossover that we can make it work\.\. I just need something to shoot for\.


**169.** `19:09` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Did you talk about this today? How hyper focused you are on this? LOO

**172.** `19:10` **You**

We talked about it\.\. but remember\.\. no specifics\.\. verbal only\.\. sorry\.


**173.** `19:10` **You**

**174.** `19:10` **You**

he validated me


**175.** `19:10` **You**

we framed it up


**176.** `19:10` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Ok good


**177.** `19:10` **You**

bounced the situation back and forth


**178.** `19:11` **You**

but recognize that the problem isn't C\.\. the problem is my history\.


**179.** `19:11` **You**

J had no past\.\. there was one guy then me\.


**180.** `19:11` **You**

So all of the trust issues I had previously


**181.** `19:11` **You**

didn't matter\.


**182.** `19:11` **You**

He said I have never dealt with those


**183.** `19:12` **You**

He believed everything I said about us\.\. had a chuckle about how I presented the story\.\. I think we connected well\.


**184.** `19:12` **You**

ok\.\. no more


**185.** `19:12` **You**

not a word\.


**186.** `19:12` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

What? Why?


**187.** `19:12` **You**

because I told you\.\. it is a chat conversation\.


**188.** `19:12` **You**

I am going to the gym soon and I don't want to type all night again\.


**189.** `19:12` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

**193.** `19:27` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Just watching handmaids tale finale\. You can call whenever


**194.** `22:21` **You**

Forgot to tell you most importantly Hugh said I was damn luck to find someone the way I described you and how I described my feelings\.  Most people don‚Äôt‚Ä¶ and some do but don‚Äôt recognize it\. While he did suggest stopping it was only from the perspective of trying to make it easier\.  Thought that might make you feel a bit better‚Ä¶ Love you xoxoü•∞\. Have a good sleep\. ‚ù§Ô∏è\. All of these stupid what if conversations will be meaningless in the not to distant future\.\. I am hopeful\.  Nite\.


**195.** `22:24` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Reaction: ‚ù§Ô∏è from Scott Hicks
