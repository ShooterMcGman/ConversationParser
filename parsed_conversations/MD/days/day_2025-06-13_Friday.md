I was reminded this morning that without having dark moments we cannot appreciate the good ones so I guess I should be thankful\.

I am late this morning because I was ai ing a way to better help me understand things\.\. perspective balance minimize miscommunication and the resulting frustrations\.\. given the already challenging situation

**015.** `06:39` **You**

Late


**016.** `06:40` **You**

And early this morning


**017.** `06:41` **You**

Doing more when I get home I think


**018.** `06:49` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Sounds helpful then


**019.** `06:49` **You**

It is more qualifying for me if my read of things is off or reasonable


**020.** `06:55` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

I think your read is likely always reasonable bc it is what you are literally experiencing\. It’s reasonable for you\. Maybe just not others\. I think it is more around expectations then reading per se


**021.** `06:56` **You**

Wouldnt mind seeing if I could get the messages you saved sometime too\.\. I think there are apps or something that can extract them\.


**022.** `06:56` **You**

Yep a bit of both mer off on expectations and possibly understanding\.\. on me\.


**023.** `06:56` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

You are not off on anything\. You are who you are\.

No I think I misread last night

I can try tonight

*💬 Reply*

**028.** `06:58` **You**

Ok I told you essentially you are the only special one to me\.\. nothing comes close everything else was empty my read of your response everything was special\.\. lol that was what I was verifying if my read was crazy and clearly not where I expected convo to go\.\. it’s fine\.\. I was just thinking perhaps certain things cannot be discussed via text\.\. still thinking about it\.


**029.** `07:00` **You**

Anyways fuck it\.\. just going to set it down\.\. we are just different in a lot of ways\.\. not a bad thing\.


**030.** `07:01` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Why didn’t you ask me to clarify or something?

*💬 Reply*

**031.** `07:01` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Can you please do that next time?


**032.** `07:02` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

I meant that I don’t look back on those things \(one night stand for instance\) as “empty”\. The experience was interesting and or amusing in one way or another\. I chalk it up to another learning experience\. Not always proud etc etc\. but I certainly wouldn’t call it empty\.


**033.** `07:03` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

I mean was I having this deep emotional experience? No\. It doesn’t mean it was “empty”\.


**034.** `07:03` **You**

Kk all good\.\. thanks for the clarity\.\.


**035.** `07:04` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

I literally cannot think of an “empty” experience\. I take something away from all\. Not super emotional and or connective experiences but certainly all learning in some way or another\. They are like little building blocks to my life…\.\.


**036.** `07:04` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

None of those blocks are “empty”\. I just cannot look at them like that\.


**037.** `07:07` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Scott, there is not one experience or person that trumps you\. I think that is why you arrived last for me\. There is no doubt\. It doesn’t mean that notion is not overwhelming and especially with the chaos in the background \(our respective lives\) … plus the speed … plus work …\. It is just a lot for me to process and I have nervous system issues lol \(seriously\)


**038.** `07:08` **You**

Mer it’s fine misunderstood and I also need to manage my expectations given everything else and your situation\.  All good\.  I will try bit to jump to conclusions\.\. I will stop bugging you so you can do your workout


**039.** `07:08` **You**

Not jump


**040.** `07:08` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

k just ask me to clarify next time


**041.** `07:11` **You**

I am just going to tone everything back a bit I think the emotion is overwhelming for me as well and has been for a while\.


**042.** `07:11` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Reaction: 😟 from Scott Hicks
I have bad cramps so waiting for my aleve and coffee to kick in 😐


**043.** `07:12` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Same\. I lie in bed now and just close my eyes and think of you/us and honestly it doesn’t mean make me feel better\.

*💬 Reply*

**044.** `07:12` **You**

I think perhaps the conversations will just need to focus on non serious stuff\.\. save the exploring for I
In person maybe despite the frequency of that


**045.** `07:12` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

But so does wine and a couple vapes lol

And just tell me if something I type sits with you in a way you aren’t sure how to interpret

*💬 Reply*

**047.** `07:14` **You**

I mean talking about the future is kind of impossible, I think I have come to an understanding with our respective pasts and that is a me issue that yku cannot help with\.\. so just need to keep it light\.  Might not be as engaging but meh\.

**050.** `07:19` **You**

Sure mer probably like I said I misunderstood and had different t expectations\.\. it’s fine I think we just avoid these types topics maybe save for in person if we decide we want to discuss\.


**051.** `07:24` **You**

Going to sauna shower and home\. Hope you feel better\.

**053.** `07:25` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Read the lyrics to that when you are done


**054.** `07:31` **You**

I listened are you trying to tell me something\.\. is it going to be ok?  Or do you want me to tell you that?  Because I try to every day\.  Even with my being down\.\. it doesn’t mean it is t going to be ok\.  It is where I am at in a point in time based o\. Whatever is happening\.\. last night was a gut punch in my head\.\. doesn’t mean I stopped loving you or had seconds second thoughts, or suddenly you aren’t my soul mate\.  You know soul mates don’t mean a ticket to easy fun time\.  This is still something we will always have to work at, but I do expect it will get a shit to\. Easier\.


**055.** `07:32` **You**

But the first part of the song is that you now?


**056.** `07:33` **You**

Reaction: 👍 from Meredith Lamb
Anyways, we can chat later maybe\.\. I am just going to sauna and shower waited to listen to the song\.


**057.** `07:33` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

No it is just on my old workout play list and never listened to the lyrics that closely before\.


**058.** `07:33` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

The overcomplicating simple things is interesting

*💬 Reply*

**060.** `07:34` **You**

Kk chat later


**061.** `07:45` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

I have a lot of work to do on myself also \(hence therapy and stuff\) … like when you get struggling, I get this urge to immediately need to fix it\. For the last 16 years I’ve dealt with a situation where when the other person indicates a struggle or frustration, if I don’t fix immediately \(with the aforementioned same always fix\) then life and my house environment are just shitty for days and it sucks\. I’m trying to release myself from that trigger…\. That probably makes no sense and I can probably better explain in person\. My therapist is helpful on this topic\.


**062.** `07:50` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Whenever you say “this is for me to work out” I honestly have NEVER heard that before\. It has always been my job to make things right and fix\.


**063.** `07:51` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

So these conversations are sometimes difficult for me to navigate in terms of what I do vs what you do to resolve\. Just being honest…


**064.** `08:16` **You**

Reaction: 👍 from Meredith Lamb
Just need to get home before I respond, didnt want you to think I read and was ignoring\.  I want to spend a minute to type it out\.  I appreciate you sharing and I know that about you\.  When I need help I promise I will ask for it\.\. to put it simply\.\. the last thing I want is for my problems to become yours\.  And sometimes I don’t ask because either I know you cannot help\.\. or you will say what I want to hear or something close because you don’t like lying\.  So anyhow let me get home will read these again\.


**065.** `08:17` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Finishing my workout then gotta get ready and drive Maelle


**066.** `10:12` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Ps\. I did all 5 workouts this week and going to bed at a decent hour to do one of last week’s missed ones tomorrow morning \(I have to drive tonight anyway\)


**067.** `10:18` **You**

Congrats I won’t be available to chat much tonight anyways so should be easy for you\.


**068.** `11:02` **You**

ok finally back to this\.\. 1\.  I think it is your default to fix things\.\. you told me your mum always said you go for needy boys\.\. which didn't make me feel great but she has a point\. 2\.  You were expected to fix things with Andrew\.    If my problem is you, something you said or did that affected me, then it isn't so much fixing as it is getting through it\.  The last few weeks especially have shown me that while we are similar in many ways, we are also really really different in many ways as well\. Our wants and needs are different, how we process things, how we express our thoughts, our feelings\.  Our perspectives, and views on us, on this relationship, on the future, etc\.  It goes to the point I made earlier\.\. Soul Mates don't = simple path forward \- but still worth everything I have to give to get there\.  I maintain\.\. despite all of this\.\. being with you, I mean I wish it was living with you, but even just being with you a couple of times a week, in some kind of predictable way will resolve a lot of this stuff\.\. or it better it will place it within the context of a greater more normal relationship\.\. which from that point of view might be a really small thing\.\. versus right now\.\. with all of the uncertainty\.\. it is a large thing\.  You don't need to fix me, I am not broke\.\. but I am rebuilding\.  I am trying to keep the best parts of who I am, and re\-engage who I was without getting pounded too much in the process\.

You cannot fix the fact that I have unrealistic expectations\.\. or even hopeful outcomes that don't happen\.\. it just is\.\. and I can either push back or accept it\.\. that is up to me\.

*💬 Reply*

**070.** `11:36` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

That was a lot and I don’t feel like you are broken\. When I mentioned urge to “fix”, it isn’t you, it is the situation\. I don’t think you are broken\.

**109.** `20:14` **You**

Not Yours Yet
after Sara Teasdale
I’m not yours—
not completely\. Not yet\.
But we both feel it,
the way everything’s leaning forward,
pulling us toward something
bigger than either of us imagined\.
I haven’t lost myself in you—
but I can see it happening\.
Little by little, I’m loosening\.
The edges of me
are softening around you\.
And I’m not afraid\.
Not anymore\.
You love me—
I feel it in the way you listen,
in how quiet the world gets
when it’s just us\.
And even though we’re not there yet,
I believe we will be\.
One day, I’ll fall into you
like light disappears into light\.
No edges\.
No holding back\.
Just us—
full and fierce and sure\.


**110.** `20:15` **You**

Now That I Know You
\(a contemporary rewrite of “The Good\-Morrow”\)
I don’t even know what I was doing
before you\.
Going through the motions, maybe\.
Trying, failing,
thinking I’d felt love before—
but it wasn’t this\.
This is different\.
This feels like I just woke up\.
Good morning\.
To both of us\.
No pretending\. No hiding\.
I don’t feel the need to impress you—
and you don’t flinch when I’m honest\.
We’re not performing\.
We’re just here\.
And somehow, that’s everything\.
Let the world chase big things—
adventures, noise, bright lights\.
I just want this\.
You and me
in this quiet room
that feels like the whole world\.
When I look at you,
I see someone who sees me back\.
And that—
that’s rare\.
This doesn’t feel like something
that fades or falls apart\.
It feels even\.
Like we both showed up
for real this time\.
And because of that,
I don’t think we’ll lose this\.
Not easily\. Not ever\.

C ya 😛


**119.** `21:09` **You**

And again to the gym with no underwear to put on after\.\. the shame\.\. unfortunate\.


**120.** `21:10` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Such a waste when you are not going home to me\. 😢


**121.** `21:11` **You**

Agreed


**122.** `21:11` **You**

I can picture how that scene plays out\.


**123.** `21:12` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

I bet my picture is better\.


**124.** `21:12` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Despite the shitty day, I really wish we were together\. My whole nervous system would feel normal again\.


**130.** `21:17` **You**

I mean that’s every day\.\. I mean speaking of feeling empty I definitely feel empty without you


**131.** `21:18` **You**

I actually breathe easier, stress goes down, feel better when we are together it is real


**132.** `21:19` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

I know\. That is why yesterday was as so difficult\. Such a monumental moment and then just slammed apart\. My body couldn’t handle it\.

Yeah I didn’t really think about what it would do\.\. I though you would kind of think it was cute or sweet and that’s be all good

“Cute or sweet” lol

It was my great grandfathers good luck charm\.\. my grandfather inherited it and wore it over seas throughout ww2 when he came home he met my nana, attributed the luck to the necklace\.  They were older whbe they met had mum after 30\.\. more luck because they didn’t think they could\.  The he gave it to mum who eventually gave it to me\. And now me to you\.

Here is the difference with you


**164.** `21:34` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

My mom has always heard about you just from my work talk


**165.** `21:34` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

She knew I admired you and liked working for you a long time before all this


**166.** `21:34` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Andrew too for that matter


**167.** `21:35` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Anyone I like in that way, people like

This isn’t a case of we met and got in a relationship


**169.** `21:35` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

We had a pre\-existing situation


**170.** `21:35` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

I remind my mom of that and she’s like “oh that’s right”


**171.** `21:35` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

She gets worried of me jumping into shit


**172.** `21:36` **You**

Well I will do my best \.\. ☺️ will see how it goes\.


**173.** `21:37` **You**

I wish you could have met mum\.\. she would have LOVED you and I guarantee you it would be more than everyone else\.\. you would have connected immediately\.

I wish I could have also tbh


**175.** `21:39` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

I can tell by how you talk about her, the videos, and her letter that it would have been good


**176.** `21:39` **You**

You would have been way more attached to her the man me lol


**177.** `21:39` **You**

Than me


**178.** `21:39` **You**

She would have taken you over


**179.** `21:39` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

My highschool bf’s mom did that and I just loved her lol weirdly enough, she died of breast cancer


**180.** `21:40` **You**

Sad\.\. it is a shitty way to go\.\.


**181.** `21:40` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

My mom will definitely be a bit not herself the first time you meet her but after that she will be


**182.** `21:40` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Hence why I want to get it over with


**183.** `21:40` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

She is socially very awkward


**184.** `21:41` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

But sorts out after a bit


**185.** `21:41` **You**

Well should be a very interesting conversation filled with awkward silences and you laughing


**186.** `21:41` **You**

ROFL


**187.** `21:42` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

I will carry her\. As always\. 😜


**188.** `21:42` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

She can’t even speak in front of a handful of people without her face going red


**189.** `21:42` **You**

I hear the same stories like 15x


**201.** `21:47` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Plus it is different hearing second hand than first hand


**202.** `21:47` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Always different

Well I can tell stories so it should be fine


**204.** `21:47` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

On any case, my mom is chatty so it will be fine but she will be apprehensive I think\. I can’t even remember introducing her to anyone LOL


**205.** `21:48` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Once she knows you, all will be better and more flexible

**252.** `22:02` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

**253.** `22:02` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

So last year I took a break\.


**254.** `22:03` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

I disliked Andrew last year also so we spent separate time at the cottage mostly


**255.** `22:03` **You**

man complicated relationship


**256.** `22:09` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Do you think more complicated than yours?


**257.** `22:09` **You**

well\.\. in many ways a lot more complicated


**258.** `22:11` **You**

A lot of push pull between you both\.\. the sex stuff\.\. I mean that is kind of twisted imho, our sex stuff wasn't like that\.\. more sad on her part\.\. kids not being on same page\.\. but honestly\.\. we never had the kind of falling outs that I feel like you have told me about\.


**259.** `22:11` **You**

our stuff never lasted beyond a night


**260.** `22:11` **You**

we would fight\.\. shit would remain unresolved for the most part


**261.** `22:12` **You**

but we would put it back in the box the next day


**262.** `22:12` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

But if the sex stuff on your side were reversed your situation would have been like mine\. You would have been “sexually frustrated” and going crazy like Andrew\. But because it was her it was different?


**263.** `22:12` **You**

reversed?? meaning if I wanted to have sex with her all the time you mean?

neither have I about the sex or anything else\.\. that is honestly why I have such a hard time\.\. so if it ever bothers you when I am down, or having a hard time\.\. remember it is only because of this feeling\.\. and the fact it won't go away ever, and that I don't have as much patience as I would like or an ability to block shit out\.

So if you come on Thursday\.\. I will have it set up so you could go straight to the room\.\. you could work remotely from there on Friday if you wanted to\.


**309.** `22:34` **You**

I think we go over to Grand Rapids and back to Detroit Saturday and Sunday\.\. and come back on Monday\.


**310.** `22:36` **You**

that gives you two days for your friend\.\. then we return home\.\. we could even see her if you wanted to\.  I would be fine with that as long as no pics\.\. at least no with me in em\.

**347.** `22:53` **You**

I think I am going to take tomorrow off completely


**348.** `22:53` **You**

Maybe just go tomorrow night for a sauna


**349.** `22:56` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

**351.** `22:56` **You**

**352.** `22:56` **You**

and it gets me out of here\.\. I have nothing else to do


**353.** `22:56` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

I just had to run down and clean the basement for McKenzie because she wants to bring over Hayden and Cameron and Leanna and she’s like the basement is not clean\. Can you run down and clean it like what the fuck


**354.** `22:57` **You**

rofl\.\. yeah taken for granted for sure


**355.** `22:57` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

I could go to my mom’s tomorrow and meet you

**367.** `23:02` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

I mean, I think she already suspects so if we go to stay over at my mom‘s tomorrow night, which we might anyways I’ve already been considering it, but it depends on how long her tournament goes tomorrow\. If we did, she would still suspect it cause she’s not stupid\.


**368.** `23:02` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

And she has seen your texts


**369.** `23:02` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

I think once she is told she will be fine\. She just doesn’t like uncertainty and not knowing shit\.


**370.** `23:03` **You**

that's what I mean\.\. so maybe we just don't\.\. would be happy to drive into the park to see you Mon or Tues\.\. if that works better\.\. I just don't want to cause stress

you don't need to agree to anything

ever it would be between J and I

**464.** `23:25` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

I think you should set up a virtual call sometime thing for me to meet your sister

Unless you want me to meet her by myself


**466.** `23:26` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**
