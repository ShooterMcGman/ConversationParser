lol


**221.** `18:48` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

He thought he was gonna be so good telling me about ‚Äúdying for sex‚Äù and I had already seen it\. He literally went home and told Kristine üôÑ


**222.** `18:48` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

I watched the whole season while he was in Scotland


**223.** `18:48` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

lol


**224.** `18:48` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Do you know what happened today?


**225.** `18:48` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

So he gets a call and it‚Äôs clearly Christine


**226.** `18:48` **You**

Kk


**227.** `18:49` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

She asked him a question and I can tell and he goes ‚ÄúI will tell you later‚Äù


**228.** `18:49` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

I swear to god she was asking how it went with my parents


**229.** `18:49` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

lol


**230.** `18:49` **You**

Yeah no doubt


**231.** `18:49` **You**

He was kinda messing with me about it as we walked over to the desk


**232.** `18:49` **You**

And about meeting your friends


**233.** `18:50` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

He‚Äôs very concerned for you


**234.** `18:50` **You**

Why


**235.** `18:50` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Well, he thinks that like they‚Äôre gonna grill you or something and they totally would not like not even close


**236.** `18:50` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

I think Christine‚Äôs friends must be different


**237.** `18:50` **You**

But why is he worried\.\. I can handle that


**238.** `18:51` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

He just said he would find it very nerve\-wracking


**239.** `18:51` **You**

Not me


**240.** `18:51` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Especially after just meeting the parents


**241.** `18:51` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

lol


**242.** `18:51` **You**

Nope I don‚Äôt think he understands our relationship


**243.** `18:51` **You**

I don‚Äôt think many would


**244.** `18:51` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Well, he hasn‚Äôt really been around us outside of work so like yeah


**245.** `18:52` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

And I can only talk about so much at work it just feels weird when you‚Äôre in an office


**246.** `18:52` **You**

Yeah we will have to actually spend some time there some night


**247.** `18:52` **You**

True


**248.** `18:52` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Yeah, they have a busy summer though so no pressure so that‚Äôs good


**249.** `18:52` **You**

Yep


**250.** `18:53` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

It would be better when he‚Äôs not socially exhausted\. He always gets socially tired in summer


**251.** `18:55` **You**

lol I mean I will have to get used to some things as we are able to spend more time regularly with each other and I can do family stuff with you because it might be a lot at first but it is what I want


**252.** `18:55` **You**

Like very much


**253.** `18:56` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

We will both have to get used to ‚Äúsome things‚Äù üôÇ


**254.** `18:59` **You**

I am looking forward to it\.\. not feeling like it is a burden


**255.** `19:00` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Me neither, not at all\. I honestly don‚Äôt even think I will have anything to get used to but who knows\.


**256.** `19:03` **You**

Not with or for you\.\. nope


**257.** `19:35` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Asking my mom what she thought about you


**258.** `19:35` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

lol


**259.** `19:38` **You**

Interested


**260.** `19:38` **You**

Also interested in what your dad thought


**261.** `19:38` **You**

I thought you already talked‚Ä¶


**262.** `19:40` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

I mean we talked the next day but I didn‚Äôt ask them\. They need time to process


**263.** `19:40` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

I could just gauge their moods etc etc how they talked and they were really good


**264.** `19:41` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

When I left she went to her sister Gail‚Äôs so I asked her what she told Gail lol


**265.** `19:44` **You**

Ah ok


**266.** `19:45` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Meh  ~ this is very my mom

*üìé 1 attachment(s)*

**267.** `19:46` **You**

That is reasonable


**268.** `19:47` **You**

And unsurprising she is your mum\.\. she cares about your well\-being\.\. and getting a signed agreement is importantly


**269.** `19:47` **You**

She is too much of a realist not a hopeless romantic


**270.** `19:49` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Literally just typed: ‚ÄúOh dear though\. I don‚Äôt like to be hugged but don‚Äôt tell him yet because it will bother him‚Äù


**271.** `19:50` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Also: ‚ÄúYou were the worst drinking that much\.‚Äù


**272.** `19:51` **You**

ROFL


**273.** `19:51` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

>
I said you did it because I told you not to and you were just being an ass and she goes: Oh good\. It‚Äôs OK for him to get an elbow then next hug\.

*üí¨ Reply*

**274.** `19:51` **You**

Maybe I don‚Äôt go for one next time\.\.


**275.** `19:52` **You**

Reaction: üòÇ from Meredith Lamb
Sounds like she has some stark honesty too lol\.


**276.** `19:53` **You**

Mer she is\. Or going to like me right now


**277.** `19:53` **You**

lol leave her be


**278.** `19:53` **You**

Not going to


**279.** `19:53` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Yes she is


**280.** `19:54` **You**

No she is focused on the right thing which is your situation\.


**281.** `19:54` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

She‚Äôs not gonna like me for drinking too much right now\. I told her I‚Äôm gonna stop again\.


**282.** `19:54` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Eventually


**283.** `19:55` **You**

Well I am happy she doesn‚Äôt have bad things to say about me\.\. but you wouldn‚Äôt tell me anyways


**284.** `19:55` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Oh, I totally would


**285.** `19:55` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

lol


**286.** `19:55` **You**

No I don‚Äôt think you would


**287.** `19:56` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Yep, I would\. I‚Äôve told Andrew all the negative things she said about him\.


**288.** `19:56` **You**

Stark


**289.** `19:56` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

lol


**290.** `19:57` **You**

Again I don‚Äôt think your mum understands the nature of our relationship and even if she did \.\.
I don‚Äôt think she would appreciate it\.


**291.** `19:57` **You**

Again I don‚Äôt blame
Her


**292.** `19:57` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

She doesn‚Äôt at all\. I haven‚Äôt told her that level of detail


**293.** `19:57` **You**

I think it would make it worse


**294.** `19:58` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Yeah, she doesn‚Äôt need to know that it would just make her worry


**295.** `19:59` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

But we know üôÇ


**296.** `19:59` **You**

That is true we do


**297.** `20:13` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**


*üìé 1 attachment(s)*

**298.** `20:13` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Is she enabling me?


**299.** `20:13` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

lol


**300.** `21:30` **You**

I think she is being a mom


**301.** `21:32` **You**

I kind of fell asleep watching a show/\.


**302.** `21:32` **You**

Not feeling the best tonight guess I just wanted it to be over with‚Ä¶


**303.** `21:35` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

I just watched the first episode of an interesting show that Jim told me to watch\. It‚Äôs on Apple called ‚Äúfriends and neighbors‚Äù starring John Hamm


**304.** `21:35` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

So he‚Äôs a guy that gets divorced and then he gets fired from his job for sleeping with someone at work


**305.** `21:35` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

lol


**306.** `21:36` **You**

Mmmm sounds interesting


**307.** `21:36` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

**308.** `21:36` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

lol


**309.** `21:37` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

**310.** `21:40` **You**

**311.** `21:41` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**
