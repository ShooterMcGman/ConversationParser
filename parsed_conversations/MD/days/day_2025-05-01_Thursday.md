Yes, time is the only solution unfortunately here\.


**060.** `17:38` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Things settle with time and the dust needs to settle a bit still


**061.** `17:39` **You**

This seems so logical to me


**062.** `17:39` **You**

But yeah Gracie is hardly that


**063.** `17:41` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

She just wants her parents to stay together


**064.** `17:41` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

At any cost


**065.** `17:41` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

That will be hard to get over


**066.** `17:43` **You**

Yep but if we had t had to deal with so much over past 5 years I would have more empathy\.


**067.** `17:45` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Yeah it has to be draining


**068.** `17:45` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

So confused


**104.** `18:41` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

On and on and on and on and on‚Ä¶\. This is the freaking neverending story

*üìé 1 attachment(s)*

**105.** `18:44` **You**

Well you can give him the choice to be part
Of it or not but that to continue on this way will only further confuse the children to what they are surely catching on to by now and can only get worse as it drags on\.


**106.** `18:46` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**


*üìé 1 attachment(s)*

**107.** `18:49` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Omg he asked if we are preparing a script/notes or just winging it


**108.** `18:49` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

I can‚Äôt even anymore‚Ä¶\.\.


**109.** `18:49` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

A script


**110.** `18:49` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

**111.** `18:52` **You**

I mean I think you just need to say you are done he doesn‚Äôt set the time table you have been patient\.\. and accommodating, played your part bud the truth which you will continue to do from them and now his time is up


**112.** `18:52` **You**

lol I don‚Äôt know how you have the patience I would have snapped long before now


**113.** `18:54` **You**

I mean I think he will just continue to find excuses to delay it will be something else when he gets back \.\. I mean  I feel for you\.\. wish I could help more


**114.** `18:56` **You**

Sorry I am probably not helping


**115.** `18:56` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

I will likely just tell them myself lol


**116.** `18:56` **You**

I mean that might be your only option at this point because he will not seem to allow this to proceed


**117.** `18:58` **You**

Only thing is how will he react he won‚Äôt do anything stupid will he


**118.** `18:58` **You**

I know you can take care of yourself this isn‚Äôt that


**119.** `18:59` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

I will wait until he gets home from whatever he is doing üòù


**120.** `19:00` **You**

**126.** `19:00` **You**

**127.** `19:00` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

**128.** `19:01` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Could be anything


**129.** `19:02` **You**

Man‚Ä¶ I just‚Ä¶


**130.** `19:03` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

He used to do them a lot in his 30s\. Then an incident happened in 2016 and he stopped\. When we separated officially he started again lol


**131.** `19:03` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

I honestly don‚Äôt care but I wanted to tell them tonight


**132.** `19:04` **You**

I think it is valid will further force him to continue to move forward and not
Drag his feet\.


**133.** `19:06` **You**

While
You don‚Äôt plan on involving lawyers to negotiate they will be drawing up your contract right\.\. Andrew just doesn‚Äôt seem
Particularly trustworthy\.


**134.** `19:07` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Yeah‚Ä¶


**135.** `19:08` **You**

Uggh this is sucky while I think you will feel better after telling them I still kinda wish he had have just gone to cottage


**136.** `19:12` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Oh guess who arrived home when I threatened to tell them myself\. He was out of breath lol


**137.** `19:12` **You**

lol well good luck mer I know it is going to be challenging but at least one of you is an adult


**138.** `19:41` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

I found a big ‚Äúmistake‚Äù in his spreadsheet and he says he doesn‚Äôt know how it happened


**139.** `19:41` **You**

**140.** `19:42` **You**

**141.** `19:42` **You**

**148.** `19:42` **You**

Or whenever it will happen eventually and then you can figure out what is next


**149.** `19:43` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

He was padding to make it look like I was getting more assets


**150.** `19:43` **You**

I mean you cannot trust him which is why lawyer\.\. the guy feels you are at fault he owes you nothing


**151.** `19:43` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Now he‚Äôs all worried he has to sell


**152.** `19:43` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Yeah contemplating a lawyer now\. Will think tonight


**153.** `19:59` **You**

Sucks mer tough spot and I know you wanted to move this forward well you can decide on lawyers at least to review it and inform you and maybe tell girls after swimming?


**154.** `19:59` **You**

So you can feel you made some progress


**155.** `20:52` **You**

You back in the budgets tonight?


**156.** `20:55` **You**

Well on my side took two hours of j screaming she is trapped

She is just fucking mad because no one wants to go back to Moncton\.  Holy hell\.  At gym now going to work this out\.


**157.** `21:02` **You**

I told her I would take both of them and work it out but she won‚Äôt do that either


**158.** `21:14` **You**

**159.** `21:14` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Ugh\. Crappy night too\. Things have gotten very nasty\. I think now I might just take a $300k lump sum spousal \+ monthly child  and be done\.


**160.** `21:14` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

**182.** `21:19` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**
