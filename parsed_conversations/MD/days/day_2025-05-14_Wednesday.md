All ok?


**004.** `06:27` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

So I was thinking maybe I go Thursday and you go Friday morning \(if you are taking day off\)\. Then, I can clean and move stuff onto front porch and cover the ring with it\!

But I need to get there earlier than you in order to do that and make it realistic


**011.** `06:36` **You**
