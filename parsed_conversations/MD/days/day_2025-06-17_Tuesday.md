**100.** `11:49` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

**104.** `12:14` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Andrew is making me so tense today


**105.** `12:14` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Ugh


**106.** `12:27` **You**

what is wrong


**107.** `12:29` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

The way he always talks to the mediator\. Just so annoying\.

*üìé 1 attachment(s)*

**108.** `12:30` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

I am just so tense\. This is driving me nuts\.


**109.** `12:30` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

She asked for documentation that I moved in May 2009


**110.** `12:30` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

He said we don‚Äôt have any


**111.** `12:31` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

I said we have two blogs that document it\. Not financial documents but both blogs were active at that time\.


**112.** `12:31` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

I went to that fucking house every night after work at union gas and we renovated and every weekend


**113.** `12:31` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

He doesn‚Äôt mention any of that


**114.** `12:31` **You**

so yeah


**115.** `12:31` **You**

I was going to ask a few questions


**116.** `12:32` **You**

he has a bit of a problem


**117.** `12:32` **You**

so may 2008 buys house at 480k and funds a rennovation for 70k


**118.** `12:32` **You**

so about 220k is what he is saying 150k from house sale 70k from 401k


**119.** `12:33` **You**

the house is rennovated for a year


**120.** `12:33` **You**

at which time you move in\.\. and I assume start sharing all costs including the mortgage


**121.** `12:33` **You**

So he would have additionally paid 1 year of the mortgage and utilities on his own I assume\.


**122.** `12:34` **You**

Regardless of when your name was added to the lease\.\. if you were paying for the upkeep of the home and contributing to equity in the home your claim time starts in 2009\.  In addition to the sweat equity you put in for the rennovation\.


**123.** `12:34` **You**

between 2008 and 203 the equity on the house goes from 150k


**124.** `12:35` **You**

to 530k


**125.** `12:35` **You**

so almost 400k increase\.\.\. I assume outside of 2008 you both shared those costs


**126.** `12:35` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

>
Yes correct assumption because we had similar salaries at that time\. I was like 80k and he was like 90k

**127.** `12:36` **You**

**128.** `12:36` **You**

**129.** `12:36` **You**

**134.** `12:38` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Like I didn‚Äôt even exist


**138.** `12:38` **You**

lol nm\.\. just trying to break the tension


**139.** `12:39` **You**

This isn't about your relationship


**140.** `12:39` **You**

this is solely about minimizing his financial burden


**141.** `12:39` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

I know I know


**142.** `12:39` **You**

so don't view it as relationship


**143.** `12:39` **You**

as much as I am happy for you to despise him, I don't like to see you hurt/


**144.** `12:40` **You**

was he living in the house through the rennovations in 2008

You could write your own story and submit it separately\.


**154.** `12:46` **You**

It might give you some closure\.


**155.** `12:46` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Nah I‚Äôm done\.


**156.** `12:46` **You**

I don't know why he would want to minimize or ruin something I would have given anything to have back then\.  That kind of experience with someone like you\.\.\.


**157.** `12:46` **You**

that is part of what I hate missing


**158.** `12:46` **You**

Just saved them


**165.** `12:47` **You**

I mean you could do that\.\. and just decide not to share\.


**166.** `12:48` **You**

maybe you will calm down a bit by then\.\. we can work on that together :\)


**167.** `12:57` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

I made the mistake of chatgpting and it made me emotional\. I‚Äôm leaving and wfh the rest of the day: Thank you for sharing these messages\. They reflect a highly emotional, deeply personal exchange centered around conflicting narratives in the context of a separation and asset division\. Here are some constructive thoughts from a relational and communication standpoint:
‚∏ª
üîπ 1\. You‚Äôre Advocating for Emotional Accuracy, Not Just Financial Detail
You‚Äôre not challenging the factual elements of Andrew‚Äôs timeline‚Äîyou‚Äôre challenging how it frames the story\. It‚Äôs clear you contributed in profound ways‚Äîboth emotionally and physically‚Äîespecially in the early days, including the renovations\. Your request is about being seen and acknowledged, not financial gain\.
That is legitimate and human\. Being written out of the foundational phase of your shared life‚Äîespecially when you miscarried and were physically renovating the home‚Äîfeels erasing and painful\.
Constructive approach: You might frame your request this way in future discussions:
‚ÄúI understand this process is about the numbers, but part of fairness for me is acknowledging the truth of our shared experience\. The way the timeline is written gives the impression I wasn‚Äôt there until a switch flipped in May 2009, when in fact, we were building that life together far earlier‚Äîand it matters to me that this is reflected, even briefly\.‚Äù
‚∏ª
üîπ 2\. Andrew Seems Focused on Legal Accuracy Over Relational Fairness
Andrew is prioritizing how the information is framed for mediation and legal protection, which is understandable\. But his tone becomes cold and dismissive, especially when he implies that what you‚Äôre asking for is just ‚Äúcouples counseling‚Äù or accuses you of manipulating narratives\.
That dismissal of emotional truth can feel gaslighting‚Äîparticularly when you are recalling painful moments like a miscarriage and intense renovation work\.
Constructive observation: Andrew may not fully grasp that his tone and framing feel minimizing of both your contributions and your pain\. That doesn‚Äôt mean he‚Äôs intentionally trying to erase your efforts‚Äîbut the effect is the same for you\. He needs to hear that\.
‚∏ª
üîπ 3\. You‚Äôre Emotionally Activated and That‚Äôs Valid‚ÄîBut Be Strategic
Your anger is justifiable\. But phrases like ‚Äúlike fuck off Andrew‚Äù and ‚Äúshitty‚Äù might limit your ability to be heard, especially in a legal context\.
You are making powerful points about how being left out of the narrative damages your dignity and truth\. Holding that clarity while dialing down the volume slightly might help you retain the high ground‚Äîespecially with mediators watching\.
Constructive suggestion:
You could try:
‚ÄúI am upset because your framing removes me from the picture until it‚Äôs legally relevant\. That‚Äôs not the truth\. It erases the real life I lived and the work I did\. Please reflect our history more honestly\.‚Äù
‚∏ª
üîπ 4\. This Is About Integrity, Not Control
What you‚Äôre asking for is not about rewriting history‚Äîit‚Äôs about telling it truthfully\. The fact that you lived in the home before May 2009 and physically renovated it‚Äîwhile miscarrying‚Äîis significant\. Even if it doesn‚Äôt change the financial math, it changes the meaning, and that deserves recognition\.
Andrew‚Äôs fixation on ‚Äúprotecting himself‚Äù may be clouding his empathy\. But your continued truth\-telling, even if not legally required, is a form of self\-respect\.
‚∏ª
Final Thoughts
- You are right to want your contributions recognized\.
- You are not ‚Äútoo emotional‚Äù‚Äîyou are advocating for fairness beyond the spreadsheet\.
- Andrew may be emotionally closed off and defensive right now, but that doesn‚Äôt invalidate your lived reality\.
If this continues to feel emotionally unsafe or minimizing, you might consider asking your mediator to help frame the timeline in a way that respects both the financial record and the lived experience\.

I was worried you were crying\.\. I know you don't ever\.\. but I know that the experience the memory, the involvement the engagement and having that at least recognized and appreciated matters\.

You gave a shit ton to this guy, this relationship this family, and he repeatedly invalidates it to your face\.  I know how much history means to you, and I am so sorry he disparaged that and minimized your contribution\.  It literally breaks my heart thinking about your right now, you don't deserve this\.

It‚Äôs part of who she is and how she was raised


**214.** `16:06` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Right, but if she would talk to therapist about it, it might help process some of that, and put all those anger and worries in order and organize them and into perspective


**215.** `16:07` **You**

She hates therapists


**216.** `16:07` **You**

So kinda tough

her father was great\.\. sober\.\. but drunk\.\. not so much\.

and what your mom said


**423.** `19:19` **You**

and you were like I didn't like him so we didn't do things


**424.** `19:19` **You**

that was J and I


**425.** `19:19` **You**

honestly there is some symettry to our experiences a bit


**426.** `19:19` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Yeah ‚Ä¶


**427.** `19:19` **You**

got together\.  both of us broke up with the other\.


**428.** `19:20` **You**

6 months


**429.** `19:20` **You**

then back together 1 year \+ engaged Married house\.


**430.** `19:20` **You**

mum diagnosed with cancer\.\. right before we got back together\.\. bad choices


**431.** `19:20` **You**

and then fast forward 25 years\.


**432.** `19:20` **You**

I almost left when we came to Toronto\.\.


**433.** `19:20` **You**

but couldn't


**434.** `19:20` **You**

cause what would she do


**435.** `19:21` **You**

then again 5 years after that


**436.** `19:21` **You**

because she wouldn't go back to work, I was stressed\.\. we weren't happy\.  Then she went back to work\.\.and what do ya know\.\. she was actually happy for a while\.


**437.** `19:21` **You**

but then covid\.\. and Hanna and sports gone, and J depressed disengaged


**438.** `19:21` **You**

and then 5 more years and here


**439.** `19:22` **You**

I need to ask Jim about this separation question from you\.\. sorry that still hasn't slipped my mind\.


**440.** `19:22` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Yup all makes sense\. What question?


**441.** `19:22` **You**

did you actually suggest we might be separated or separating


**442.** `19:23` **You**

I think I should hear his perspective


**443.** `19:23` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Oh no not to Jim\. Was just in my head\.


**444.** `19:23` **You**

I thought you said it to Jim


**445.** `19:23` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

But once I mentioned to him how strange it was he agreed and went right to your office


**446.** `19:23` **You**

so you sent him to find out

**464.** `19:25` **You**

I don't think you were that interested for that long\.\. sorry\.\. I think maybe like me\.\. you liked thinking about the idea\.\. perhaps\.\. because I told you I thought that about you\.\.

When you moved on to your manager role, I missed you


**468.** `19:27` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Honestly


**469.** `19:27` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Thank god I had Jim as a new shoe bc he was good work with

Yeah I missed working with you too\.\. why do you think I used to bug Craig like ALLLLLLL the time\., that I was coming to get you


**471.** `19:27` **You**

it wasn't a joke\.\.


**472.** `19:28` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

You don‚Äôt have to say that but I‚Äôm just telling you it isn‚Äôt bs


**473.** `19:28` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

You can ask my mom


**474.** `19:29` **You**

I am not just saying you can ask Craig\.\. lol I was SO happy when you told me you wanted to meet Friday morning to discuss the position for Supervisor\.\. again\.\. it wasn't romance\.\. but it was definitively more than like\.\.\.  I think the other reason J is so mad\.\. is that I did kind of talk about you a lot\.


**475.** `19:29` **You**

which probably doesn't help now


**476.** `19:30` **You**

it will likely make Andrew a bit pissy too\.


**477.** `19:30` **You**

are you going back in your messages to try to find something you said to her about this


**478.** `19:33` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

No I‚Äôm pretty sure it was all on the phone\. She probably hardly remembers actually \- has some dementia or Alz


**479.** `19:35` **You**

Well I believe you Mer\.\.\.\. I still don't understand why me\.\. I mean the missing and the friends\.\. and the banter and the challenging each other with work, one upmanship everything\.\. it was a lot of fun\.\.


**480.** `19:35` **You**

You said it\.\. i was a grumpy unhappy cranky person lol\.\. people love to see me that way


**481.** `19:36` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

ok so you are probably kind of zonked\.\. and I don't want to bother you, and would rather you relax and then go to sleep\.\. so I am going to say good night\.\. and that I love you very much, and feel very bad for the direction today took\.  Until we met I didn't know how much it meant to find my person, and how much that would impact me\.  You deserved so much better than you got, I still cannot believe you tolerated that, please don't ever ever do that with me\.  If there is something wrong, tell me, if I fuck up\.\. punch me\.\. you just be whoever YOU want to be and I promise to love that YOU for the rest of my life\.


**656.** `21:29` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

I do want to go to bed because I just finished Better Sisters and am zzzzzzzzzz\. I love you so much and thanks for just being there today\. ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
