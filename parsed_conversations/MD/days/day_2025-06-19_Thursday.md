Or civil personal


**020.** `04:13` **You**

Yeah mean\.  And I think I mentioned I kind of said we were going to happen\.


**021.** `04:13` **You**

That is probably what bothers her most


**022.** `04:13` **You**

Honestly


**023.** `04:13` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Yeah you mentioned that\.


**024.** `04:13` **You**

But again it is just an excuse


**025.** `04:13` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Just because it is so fast


**026.** `04:13` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Feels like cheating?


**027.** `04:14` **You**

To not address what really happened


**028.** `04:14` **You**

You know what it never felt like that to me


**029.** `04:14` **You**

Honestly


**030.** `04:14` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

And that is partly why we fight


**050.** `04:18` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**
