Omg sleep in\. I have a meeting at 9 and Erin wants to have morning chat before at some point\. xo


**003.** `07:29` **You**

I am already up big fight apparently Gracie got into my chat gpt and saw something about the gym and a coffee shop\.  So I had to admit that I had a conversation with someone at the gym and that I was thinking about actually asking them to grab a coffee\.  Obviously that is about you,  if I wasn‚Äôt saying that\.  Anyone not a massive explosion but a lot of
Guilt and bullshit being thrown around\.  I basically said I am just going to accelerate my timeline to leave\.   Very frustrated
Drained and tired today\.  Leaving in a few don‚Äôt worry you focus on work today all good\.  Have a good one\! ‚ù§Ô∏è

I mean the more support you can get the better you will feel\.


**016.** `09:13` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Yeah, especially after my scolding last night\. I essentially got in trouble for not having our finances exactly figured out and blamed for that so now he says he can‚Äôt do the Julian/cassy thing bc of me\. When it isn‚Äôt bc of me\. He just likes to blame me\. I told him he was scolding me and he said his voice wasn‚Äôt raised so how could he be scolding? Omg\. Then he wouldn‚Äôt leave\. Gahhhh


**017.** `09:14` **You**
