**215.** `16:14` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

I just worked there


**216.** `16:16` **You**

I like it here


**217.** `16:17` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Are you not just in the hotel? Lol


**218.** `16:17` **You**

Nope


**219.** `16:17` **You**

I went to Best Buy


**220.** `16:17` **You**

And then I need a snack before supper


**221.** `16:18` **You**

Because damn I am hungry


**222.** `16:20` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Ahhh Chatham is OK


**223.** `16:20` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Not sure I‚Äôd ever live in Chatham\. A bunch of better places


**224.** `16:20` **You**

I guess anything but Toronto\.\.  I just thought I could work out of Chatham


**225.** `16:21` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Better places within driving distance


**226.** `16:21` **You**

I mean if j went back to Moncton\. I would think of transferring to Chatham


**227.** `16:21` **You**

Would be much easier for me to afford


**228.** `16:22` **You**

Eventually


**229.** `16:22` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Or you could just move in with me


**230.** `16:22` **You**

Yeah I could do that\.


**231.** `16:22` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

üôÇ


**232.** `16:22` **You**

Still I don‚Äôt think your kids or Andrew would be happy


**233.** `16:22` **You**

lol


**234.** `16:23` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Andrew doesn‚Äôt have a say\. My kids would be fine


**235.** `16:24` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Besides I wouldn‚Äôt tell Andrew lol


**236.** `16:24` **You**

Well I would want everything absolutely rock solid and finalized with J so it would be a little ways out and would need another job at
Enbridge\.


**237.** `16:24` **You**

But yeah like I said


**238.** `16:24` **You**

It felt so easy with you\.\. I don‚Äôt think that changes


**239.** `16:25` **You**

We aren‚Äôt putting in airs for each other we are mid 40s we take each other as we are


**240.** `16:25` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Why did you think it would feel different?


**241.** `16:25` **You**

I didn‚Äôt know what to expect\.\. I hadn‚Äôt spent time like that with anyone else in 25 years\.


**242.** `16:26` **You**

I figured it would be good if for no other reason than I know what you are like at work


**243.** `16:27` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

But you didn‚Äôt think it would feel ‚Äúeasy‚Äù?


**244.** `16:28` **You**

I didn‚Äôt know I don‚Äôt want to disappoint you\.\. I have my idiosyncratic ways\. So lol I just
Didnt assume


**245.** `16:28` **You**

I figured I would be the one to annoy you not the other way around


**246.** `16:29` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

If I thought you were annoying in any way we would not be talking right now lol trust me


**247.** `16:31` **You**

See that is scary lol you don‚Äôt see it though\.  The way I read that is \- if I were to find something about you annoying‚Ä¶‚Ä¶
Fill in blank\. lol\. Your mind does it‚Äôs wacky things mine does my own foolishness


**248.** `16:32` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Fill in the blank?


**249.** `16:32` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Huh? Like you think I would hide it if I was annoyed by you?


**250.** `16:32` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

I‚Äôm not at that stage in my life


**251.** `16:33` **You**

**255.** `16:33` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

But it will be minor


**256.** `16:33` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Relative to who you are generally and who I am in love with


**257.** `16:34` **You**

I haven‚Äôt tired to be someone I am not with you so there is that


**258.** `16:36` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**
