But there is nothing here to talk about\.\. talk about your day, what you bought how the kids are, what the fuck were those texts this morning and how did that start up\.\. but how I am feeling is shitty\.\. I don't feel optimistic, I don't feel happy, and this environment is just getting worse\.\. so again\.\. me piling my problems onto you only makes you feel worse and I don't want that\.
