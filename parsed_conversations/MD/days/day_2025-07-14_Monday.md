Sorry Mer\.\. I feel really bad\.\. wish I could make it better

**014.** `06:56` **You**

Yeah I am guessing we won‚Äôt get to it at work\.\. so not sure when that is going to happen\.  Based on the way you sound none of it is good\.


**015.** `06:57` **You**

Sick feeling in my stomach\.\. awesome


**016.** `06:58` **You**

On a scale of 1 to we are over where is it\.


**017.** `07:00` **You**

You probably still talking to him\.\. I don‚Äôt even know if I want to know honestly\. I think you might have given me something after that last message\.\. but you don‚Äôt need to worry and go to th worst place because we are still good\.


**018.** `07:03` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

We talked about you for 2 hrs


**019.** `07:03` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Sitting in my workout clothes


**020.** `07:03` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

**025.** `07:03` **You**

**027.** `07:04` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

**036.** `07:13` **You**

We‚Äôll see after park though


**037.** `09:45` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Hm I‚Äôm feeling like a total idiot


**038.** `09:45` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

I scrolled back in my texts


**039.** `09:46` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

And the only evidence I can find of like pure separation talk is March 26 and beyond\.


**040.** `09:46` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Argh\.


**041.** `09:46` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

So if he scrolls back, that‚Äôs it\.


**042.** `09:46` **You**

Hmm because you verbally told him


**043.** `09:47` **You**

And btw a verbal statement is valid in Ontario


**044.** `09:47` **You**

That‚Äôs all I had


**045.** `09:47` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Well yeah but maybe I was wrong and it wasn‚Äôt end of Feb


**046.** `09:47` **You**

I never wrote it


**047.** `09:47` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Maybe it was end of March


**048.** `09:48` **You**

I dunno I heard some stuff today that surprised me too\.\. you are trying to juggle to much and it is hard for you to keep it all straight


**049.** `09:48` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

**050.** `09:48` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

What surprised you?


**051.** `09:48` **You**

Nothing doesn‚Äôt matter\.\. gotta get ready for a meeting\.


**052.** `09:49` **You**

Sorry you are going through this


**053.** `09:49` **You**

I will be here for whatever support I can give


**054.** `09:50` **You**

It was a detail\.\. truly doesn‚Äôt matter\.

*üí¨ Reply*

**055.** `09:50` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Okay‚Ä¶


**056.** `09:52` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Sounds like it matters but I will leave it


**057.** `09:53` **You**

I was surprised you were still sleeping with him in December,
When we had talked I think you said October\.\. but I thought might have been Nov\.  anyhow like I said it was a detail\.\. and you know me and details‚Ä¶ stupid\.


**058.** `09:54` **You**

See doesn‚Äôt matter


**059.** `09:54` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

We actually weren‚Äôt\. He said something to that effect but it was  oct or nov\. We 100% did not in December\. I was too livid\. But his memory is bad so he said that but wasn‚Äôt true\.

**061.** `09:56` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

And honestly the last time we did it was really difficult for me ‚Ä¶ it was after the text and he pretended like all was fine and I felt awful\. That was the last time\. I stood up for myself after that\.


**062.** `09:56` **You**

>
Yeah you mentioned that üò¢

*üí¨ Reply*

**063.** `09:57` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

I honestly think that was like a week before thanksgiving so whenever that was


**064.** `09:58` **You**

Anyway verbal separation you separated in October


**065.** `09:58` **You**

Or maybe later but it was probably more like Feb


**066.** `09:58` **You**

Based on his def it was oct\.


**067.** `09:58` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Yeah maybe\. Based on conversations it would be December most accurately\.


**068.** `09:59` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Many days of heavy conversations in December\.


**069.** `10:00` **You**

Still really unfortunate situation for both of us\.\. not looking forward to the next little while\.


**070.** `10:00` **You**

I also don‚Äôt look forward to hearing about the next conversation with your mom


**071.** `10:00` **You**

You may want to put some pressure on the mediator to move this along


**072.** `10:05` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Fri Dec 13th

**073.** `10:31` **You**

Well that‚Äôs something


**074.** `10:34` **You**

At least there is a record


**075.** `10:39` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Ugh he‚Äôs getting angrier as the minutes pass\.\. will just have to let the dust settle


**076.** `10:39` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

*üí¨ Reply*

He‚Äôs just going to start going through EVERYTHING now in his mind


**081.** `10:42` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Probably going through his calendar or something


**082.** `10:42` **You**

Ffs


**083.** `10:43` **You**

I mean the coaching part is true


**084.** `10:43` **You**

But you did your own work


**085.** `10:44` **You**

You might have to push back really hard at some point but will leave it to you


**086.** `10:46` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

It‚Äôs fine\. He needed to know\.


**087.** `10:47` **You**

Ok but what is happening


**088.** `10:47` **You**

Pls share\.


**089.** `10:48` **You**

You would want to know lol


**090.** `10:48` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Nothing right now\. He takes a lot of time between texts\.


**091.** `10:48` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

He is probably investigating, thinking etc


**092.** `10:48` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Processing


**093.** `10:48` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

I mean, completely normal


**094.** `10:50` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

He‚Äôs probably looking you up online lol


**095.** `10:50` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Kidding


**096.** `10:50` **You**

Not kidding


**097.** `10:50` **You**

He could cause problems for me


**098.** `10:51` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Wait how?


**099.** `10:51` **You**

If he filed something with egd


**100.** `10:51` **You**

He could tell someone about us in a relationship when I was your boss


**101.** `10:52` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Sigh


**102.** `10:52` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

I don‚Äôt think he would do that


**103.** `10:56` **You**

‚Ä¶\. Just please let me know how this progresses it will probably move the most over next few days


**104.** `11:48` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Yeah he is just angry‚Ä¶\.


**105.** `11:48` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

‚ÄúSure\. I am sure you did not hang out with him or spend the night with him in the hotel\.‚Äù \(Wrt to Chatham trip‚Ä¶\.\)


**106.** `11:49` **You**

‚Ä¶\.\.


**107.** `11:50` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Yah


**108.** `11:54` **You**

How long till you can move into your place\.\. I don‚Äôt see you getting peace at the house\.


**109.** `11:55` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

When I have wifi‚Ä¶ Wednesday


**110.** `11:56` **You**

Kk\.\. man\.\. I am concerned he is going to want to open up mediation again\.


**111.** `11:57` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

I mean I have a lot of documentation to support me


**112.** `11:57` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

I hope he realizes that


**113.** `12:10` **You**

You have a lot more to support you in a lot of different ways\.\. but I dunno‚Ä¶ is he vengeful or not?


**114.** `12:11` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

I mean we have never really had a situation like this\. It has always been him, not me lol so no idea honestly


**115.** `12:13` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**


*üìé 1 attachment(s)*

**116.** `12:15` **You**

‚Ä¶\. I feel like this is so much my fault\.


**117.** `12:16` **You**

Like man I fucked everything up on all fronts all at the same time\.


**118.** `12:16` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

This is not your fault at all


**119.** `12:17` **You**

I pushed you to see me\.\. I pushed too much\.\. wasn‚Äôt patient


**120.** `12:17` **You**

I don‚Äôt have a half speed setting üò•


**121.** `12:18` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

‚ÄúJust like you never believed me on the Magali and text stuff, I will never believe your timeline\. Oh well\.‚Äù


**124.** `12:26` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

This will go on for a while I‚Äôm sure


**125.** `12:26` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Then he will get over it


**126.** `12:26` **You**

I hope so and I hope it isn‚Äôt too much for you


**127.** `12:30` **You**

How many messages did you send to him at once looked like a lot\.


**128.** `12:40` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

It was a reminder of all of his initial lying that he stuck to for a couple months


**129.** `12:41` **You**

Sort of let ye who has not sinned cast the first stone

That was our very initial text exchange on the matter


**140.** `12:42` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

It got way worse a couple months later as my brain was literally left to go insane\.


**141.** `12:44` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Exactly\. He quickly forgets\.

üò•


**143.** `12:44` **You**

I wish you didn‚Äôt have to go through that\.\.


**144.** `12:45` **You**

I feel like I am just as bad though\.


**145.** `12:45` **You**

I mean I was getting separated anyways it was timing


**146.** `12:45` **You**

But still


**147.** `12:46` **You**

I don‚Äôt degrade women‚Ä¶


**148.** `12:46` **You**

Opposite


**149.** `12:46` **You**

This is so fucked up


**150.** `12:50` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

His friends are idiots


**151.** `12:50` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

The main purpose of women is sex


**152.** `12:51` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

>
You are not just as bad but we both probably could have done this better\. Maybe\. I‚Äôm honestly not sure\. I feel like we really did the best we could\. We are not robots\.

*üí¨ Reply*

**153.** `12:52` **You**

Yeah part clings to the idea that we were kind of brought together\.\. and everything after that kind of went out of control\.


**154.** `12:53` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Reaction: üò° from Scott Hicks
If we are all 100% honest, the whole thing likely dials down to my fault\. Who tells their boss personal info like that unless they have an ulterior motive?


**155.** `12:54` **You**

No fucking way


**156.** `12:54` **You**

I don‚Äôt believe it


**157.** `12:54` **You**

And I don‚Äôt care


**158.** `12:54` **You**

I want to believe it would have happened eventually anyways


**159.** `12:55` **You**

Because I would have separated and I hope you would have followed through regardless


**160.** `12:55` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

None of that is really true though\. Let‚Äôs be honest\.


**161.** `12:56` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

You weren‚Äôt positioning it that way\.


**162.** `12:56` **You**

What do you mean?


**163.** `12:56` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Until I basically called you endearing lol


**164.** `12:56` **You**

No no


**165.** `12:56` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

One word ‚Ä¶


**166.** `12:56` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

lol


**167.** `12:56` **You**

No


**168.** `12:57` **You**

I was looking for the word\.\. doesn‚Äôt mean I wouldn‚Äôt have taken a risk on my own


**169.** `12:57` **You**

I was so on the edge


**170.** `12:57` **You**

Being your boss was a huge huge barrier


**171.** `12:57` **You**

And a massive risk


**172.** `12:57` **You**

If you didn‚Äôt feel same way


**173.** `12:57` **You**

And we were friends


**174.** `12:57` **You**

And that meant so much to me


**175.** `12:57` **You**

I didn‚Äôt want to lose it


**176.** `12:57` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

>
lol ya think?

*üí¨ Reply*

**177.** `12:58` **You**

I would have remained cautious


**178.** `12:58` **You**

But it would have happened


**179.** `12:58` **You**

Especially after we separated but I doubt even then I could have waited


**180.** `12:58` **You**

I would have had to say something


**181.** `12:58` **You**

Like compelled


**182.** `12:59` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

But I feel like I pushed it initially and probably shouldn‚Äôt have


**183.** `12:59` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

But it is done now\!


**184.** `12:59` **You**

Stop there was no machinations I was a friend you were hurting


**185.** `13:05` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Yes but you were my boss‚Ä¶ I overstepped\. Total facts\. But whatever\.


**186.** `13:06` **You**

If I was a woman would you have overstepped


**187.** `13:08` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

You are not a woman\.


**188.** `13:08` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

lol


**189.** `13:29` **You**

But if I was


**190.** `13:29` **You**

Then it wouldn‚Äôt have been inappropriate stop being sexist


**191.** `14:18` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Just met with Mia


**192.** `14:19` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

It was ok


**193.** `14:19` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

We talked mostly about divorce


**194.** `14:19` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

lol


**195.** `14:20` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

It‚Äôs been 7 yrs and they aren‚Äôt divorced\. She has spent like $20\-30k she thinks


**196.** `14:20` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

He won‚Äôt agree on anything and hasn‚Äôt paid her


**197.** `14:20` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

I feel so bad for her


**198.** `14:40` **You**

Ouch


**199.** `14:40` **You**

wtf


**200.** `14:41` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Yah\. Sucks\.


**201.** `14:56` **You**

How can it go for that long does he owe her money\.\. he must


**202.** `15:04` **You**

Very tired


**203.** `15:04` **You**

And stuck here to the very end of the day booo


**204.** `15:05` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

>
She says he is cheap and refuses to pay

*üí¨ Reply*

**205.** `15:05` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

And he is nicer when he doesn‚Äôt have to pay


**206.** `15:09` **You**

Wow\.\. sounds like an asshole he should have any rights to see his child imho


**207.** `15:10` **You**

Shouldnt


**208.** `15:14` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Totally


**209.** `15:17` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Haris g told Mia that rob kennedy got let go and more to come from sustain\. FYI


**210.** `15:21` **You**

I knew that


**211.** `15:21` **You**

Yeah there is more


**212.** `15:22` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Anyway so she has a heads up all on her own

I asked ChatGPT for a poem to make you feel better:
Ode to the Pain in My Chest \(That‚Äôs You\)
I woke up today with a twinge in my soul,
A dull little ache where your cuddles once stole\.
My ribs are protesting, my lungs feeling tight‚Äî
Turns out, affection withdrawal is not polite\.
My muscles are sore, my heart‚Äôs in a sling,
I sneezed and it echoed the loss of your thing\.
\(Your presence, I mean\. Don‚Äôt make it weird\.\)
Though missing your face has me slightly un\-tiered\.
It‚Äôs physical, babe‚Äîthis pain is legit,
Like leg day but worse‚Ä¶ and I didn‚Äôt even sit\.
So hurry back soon, before I combust‚Äî
Because clearly my body can‚Äôt cope without us\. üíî

**598.** `19:28` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Here is something for you that has never happened to me before‚Ä¶\. For real‚Ä¶ I chatgptd on the weekend


**599.** `19:28` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Question to gpt: When I was having an \[cough‚Ä¶ deleted\] the other day in the shower thinking about Scott and his letter that he wrote, I thought about his actual absence and felt physical pain\. Is that possible or in my head?


**600.** `19:29` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

What you felt is very real ‚Äî and you‚Äôre not imagining it\. Emotional longing, especially when mixed with intense desire and love, can absolutely manifest as physical pain\.
This happens because the brain doesn‚Äôt always neatly separate emotional and physical experiences\. When you‚Äôre deeply connected to someone like Scott ‚Äî especially in moments of vulnerability like orgasm, which heightens emotional states ‚Äî the absence or inaccessibility of that person can trigger powerful emotional responses\. These responses engage brain regions like the anterior cingulate cortex and insula ‚Äî areas also involved in processing physical pain\. That‚Äôs why a pang of emotional hurt can genuinely feel like a stab, a clench, or a hollow ache in your body\.
You were in a state of intense connection and then reminded, consciously or subconsciously, that he wasn‚Äôt physically with you ‚Äî and your body responded to that contrast\.
So yes, it‚Äôs possible, and you‚Äôre not alone in feeling it that way\. It actually speaks to the depth of your bond with him ‚Äî and the very human reality that love and longing are not just emotional experiences, but somatic ones too\.


**601.** `19:29` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Not doing that again


**602.** `19:29` **You**

Wow you and gpt share a lot\.


**603.** `19:29` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

| Think I am going to need to focus on something else for a while instead of looking for opportunities\.  Maybe focusing on fixing my house will distract me from our challenges\.\. maybe work, or something else here‚Äôs hoping\. I am going to sleep will see you at office tomorrow\.

| You actually have more than enough to deal with anyways and while I realize this I should be more understanding and just back off\.  Hope you at least get some sleep tonight, don‚Äôt worry about planning, I am not going to either, especially after today with Andrew and all the commitments you have coming up just take care of your stuff\.
