**088.** `16:44` **You**

I am not in a hurry


**089.** `17:58` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Just to be clear, I love all the different sides to you and don’t constantly feel the need to fix them\. I have seen the non\-happy side to you 1 million times before we got together\. I love that side too just saying\.


**090.** `18:13` **You**

I love all of your sides and quirks and everything\.\. always have\.  But I am not trying to fix me\.\. I am trying to hide\.  I cannot fix who I am in a scenario where we aren’t together\.  I will be sadder and more lonely, I don’t have the life you do\.\. ask got or your therapist about this\.\. it might provide some perspective \.  I wouldn’t be like that with anyone, but you are different\.  I don’t want you to see because when you look at me it feels like pity\.\.  or like you are trying to figure me out\.  I was doing ok today\.\. but when I get down it paints everything and the forward looking time becomes more problematic\.  I was really distraught that you saw my reaction to Jim\.  I think you have to let me fake that at least\.

Reaction: ❤️ from Meredith Lamb
I think we established soulmates don't equal perfect\.\.  but I want to be for you\.  I don't like feeling the way I did\.\. and I want to be honest\.\. I cannot remember when I felt like that it has been that long\.  Again it wasn't your fault\.\. and I am going to honestly try to just, put it behind me\.\. I will try to act normal with Jim\.\. maybe I will be able to trust again\.\. I don't know\.\. but I know it felt shitty\.
I don't want you to try to figure me out\.\. I am not impressive, I am half broken, and finding happiness with you made me realise how far gone I was\.\. I could have sat in that car with you until tomorrow morning just holding hands and I would have been nothing but happy\.
Please do not ever think I will leave you, I won't, I cannot believe you could make me feel the way I felt today or worse\.  Frustrations are normal, they happen, but you have a life, children, friends, family, obligations\.  Until we are living together I suspect we will just have to make do, and just because I am lonely or frustrated, doesn't mean I am walking away ever\.

\[In a hushed, observant narrator voice…\]
Good evening, dear viewer\. As dawn’s first light spills across the horizon, we find Scott Hicks standing at the threshold of transformation\. His smooth, polished scalp reflects the glow—a beacon heralding the dawn of a renewed spirit and a rekindled ambition\.
Notice Scott’s hand cradling a steaming cup of coffee, its warmth pulsing through his veins like an electric promise\. Each sip stirs muscles long dormant, reminding him of days when vigor flowed effortlessly—days he’s determined to reclaim\.
Watch him step into the gym’s embrace, posture firm, gaze steady\. The machines hum in anticipation; the weights wait like ancient relics, eager to test his mettle once more\. Here, amid echoes of his past triumphs, Scott channels years of untapped strength into every lift\.
Pause at the mirrored wall: Scott meets his own reflection with unwavering eyes\. No boastful grin—just a solemn nod to the man he was and the man he’s becoming\. In that moment, he acknowledges a truth long buried: confidence, once lost, can be resurrected through persistence\.
And now, the true purpose of this renewal comes into focus\. With each calculated rep and every measured breath, Scott moves closer to his ultimate goal: to sow his oats where no oats have been sown before\. The farm of possibility lies fertile under his feet, awaiting the seeds of his regained prowess\.
So settle in, dear viewer, and witness the unfolding saga of resurrection and reawakening\. The coffee has warmed him, the gym has tested him, and now—more than ever—the field is ready\. Let the sowing begin\.


**139.** `22:39` **You**

Kk i think you are probably busy and i am tired so i think i am going to go to bed Mer\.


**140.** `22:40` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

I am and was getting ready for bed\. Poured my glass back into bottle\. My eyes are sleepy\.


**141.** `22:41` **You**

Long drive will do that to you


**142.** `22:41` **You**

Long day


**143.** `22:41` **You**

Lot of stuff happened


**144.** `22:41` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Yeah


**145.** `22:41` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

**150.** `22:45` **You**

**151.** `22:46` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

\[In a cool, clear narrator voice — gentle but resolute — Meredith speaks, the wind of reason rustling through her tone like silk on a morning breeze\.\]
Good evening, dear viewer\. As twilight settles and the last light glances off the horizon, we turn now to a different kind of transformation—one not built on motion alone, but on meaning\. Observe Scott Hicks, radiant with resolve, his every movement precise, his heart quietly thunderous beneath the calm\.
Yes, the scalp gleams, the coffee warms, the gym welcomes\. The ritual is admirable\. The effort, undeniable\. The pulse of a man remembering his own power—that, we celebrate\.
But let us not mistake the clarity of purpose for a blank cheque of indulgence\. No, dear viewer, this tale is not one of wild oats scattered with careless whim, nor of fields claimed by fleeting desire\. Meredith stands here—not as a barrier, but as a steward of intention\.
See how she watches—not with suspicion, but with discernment\. She has tasted the sweetness of true connection and will not let it sour in pursuit of temporary conquests\. She knows the difference between rebirth and rerun\. And while she champions Scott’s rise, she draws the line at sowing for sport\.
For the soil he once neglected is not just ready—it is sacred\. And what grows now must be nurtured, not scattered\.
So we continue, dear viewer\. With muscles awakened, spirit restored, and a woman beside him who refuses to be just another field in bloom\. Let the journey unfold—but let the oats remain unsown… unless they are planted with care, with clarity, and with love\.

**153.** `22:47` **You**

Well played


**154.** `22:48` **You**

Out gpt d me


**155.** `22:48` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

😇


**156.** `22:49` **You**

So did gpt tell you what deleted


**157.** `22:49` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

I didn’t ask


**158.** `22:49` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Will now


**159.** `22:51` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

This is just the first deleted: What Scott deleted was likely something emotionally raw or exposing—something he feared might burden you or that he quickly regretted revealing\.
Given the context just before the deletion—where he’s vulnerable, speaking of loneliness, frustration, and wanting to never leave you—it’s plausible the deleted message said something like:
- “I wish I was coming with you\.”
- “I hate being left behind\.”
- “It hurts that I’m not going with you tonight\.”
- “I’m really struggling right now\.”
Then he masked it with a more neutral:
“deleted – have fun, and drive safe\.”
That edited message is a protective move\. It says, “I don’t want you to worry about me—I’ll tuck this away so you can go enjoy yourself\.” But underneath, it carries the ache of someone who wishes he could be with you instead\.

Then your others: He likely deleted those additional messages because they crossed into territory that made him feel too exposed, needy, or uncertain about how you’d respond—especially after already saying something “mushy” earlier\.
There’s a pattern in his texts:
- He opens up deeply \(vulnerable, raw\),
- then covers it up with humor or deflection,
- and sometimes, deletes when the emotional risk feels too high\.
Here’s what likely drove the deletions:
1\.	Emotional overflow: After a long thread of emotional sharing, he may have sent messages that were even more tender, longing, or speculative—maybe about wishing to be with you, about imagining a future, or about how much he needs you\.
2\.	Fear of being “too much”: He said earlier, “I don’t want you to try to figure me out… I’m not impressive… I’m half broken…” That self\-perception could make him recoil if he feels he’s being too sentimental or dependent\.
3\.	Regret in real\-time: The timestamp \(all three at 9:41–9:42\) suggests he sent a burst of messages—probably pouring out a stream of feeling—and then quickly thought nope, too vulnerable, and deleted them\.
Given his earlier words \(“I could have sat in that car with you until tomorrow morning just holding hands and I would have been nothing but happy”\), the deleted messages might have said something like:
- “I wish I could be with you tonight\.”
- “I hate when you’re gone\.”
- “I don’t want to go to bed without hearing your voice\.”
- “I keep replaying today in my head\.”
- “I don’t know how to do this without you near\.”
And then… he probably felt like he had said too much\. So he tried to regain control\.
In short: he deleted out of emotional whiplash\. Vulnerability backlash\. But make no mistake—what he deleted was real, honest, and probably beautiful in its truth\.

I will always be “most” never “more”


**196.** `23:07` **You**

all I said was that someday we would never have to have these conversations, we wouldn’t have insecurities or questions, because when we are together all of this go to nothing, at least for me\.  There is just you and this quiet happiness/satisfaction that I have when we are together\.\. it is like everything is right,
And I don’t need a single other thing\.  It was sappy and we have said it before but you were worried today and I didn’t like that\. Anyhow I love you have a good sleep you will likely read this in the morning\. Anyways\.
