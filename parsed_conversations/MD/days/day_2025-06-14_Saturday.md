One time\.\. well I think you might have been working for me I had a uti then got covid then had another uti back to back to back

Yeah I had a couple a year or so ago\. Apparently it is a ‚Äúperimenopause‚Äù thing\. üòú yippee\. It isn‚Äôt the fact that I had a minor illness\. It was the fact \(and was the last time also\) AGAIN that Andrew could care less and just continues to expect normal operation from me\. Tell me what to do blahblah\. I just need out of this house\.


**034.** `06:58` **You**

I was just thinking when we were chatting how uncomfortable for a woman that would be Jesus


**035.** `07:00` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Anyway I don‚Äôt even think it was a uti but it felt like it\. Similar symptoms but for one\. They treated me with a one dose pill for a yeast infection and I‚Äôm almost fine\. So may not be a uti\. They said to do this first\. All annoying perimenopause crap\. lol this stuff doesn‚Äôt happen in 20s and 30s

I just wasn‚Äôt sure if you were trying to make me feel better or something


**157.** `12:32` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

So I kind of felt like you were making that up, but I kind of felt like you weren‚Äôt so I was kind of kidding

We absolutely fought the whole time about grace


**163.** `12:33` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

And what was the end result?


**164.** `12:34` **You**

Same we both on fundamentally different pages


**165.** `12:34` **You**

And frustrated


**166.** `12:34` **You**

I told her if nothing else this clearly demonstrated there was no coming back from this


**167.** `12:34` **You**

And she grudgingly agreed


**168.** `12:35` **You**

Then we talked about continuing to share Netflix and prime and everything


**169.** `12:35` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

What do you want, what does she want wrt to Gracie?


**170.** `12:35` **You**

And she said when you finally get with someone they won‚Äôt want you to keep the sharing going on


**171.** `12:35` **You**

I laughed


**172.** `12:35` **You**

>
It was more assessing Gracie‚Äôs involvement in all of the and where we landed because I take the brunt of everything

*üí¨ Reply*

**173.** `12:36` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Oh I see


**174.** `12:36` **You**

She said women care about that kind of shit\-re Netflix


**175.** `12:36` **You**

I was like what??? That so stupid


**176.** `12:37` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Well naturally you will get the brunt because you carried the family in an unequal way so then you‚Äôll get an unequal part of the blame also\. It kind of makes sense even if it isn‚Äôt fair\.


**177.** `12:37` **You**

She said something about whoever I get with will resent any connections I have to her going forward\.\.


**178.** `12:37` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

>

A lot of the people on McKenzie‚Äôs volleyball team were divorced and the divorced parents all had new partners, but the partners were all like the same age


**190.** `12:39` **You**

Well then you and I are in sync


**191.** `12:39` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

When McKenzie was with Andrew once he said he just didn‚Äôt understand why anyone would get divorced and go out with someone the same age when they could go with someone much younger


**192.** `12:40` **You**

Omfg


**193.** `12:40` **You**

Mackenzie thinks Andrew will date someone much younger


**209.** `12:41` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

She‚Äôs worried lol


**210.** `12:42` **You**

He might


**211.** `12:42` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

I‚Äôm immature I guess\.


**212.** `12:42` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

lol


**213.** `12:42` **You**

Naw you just like them younger men\.


**214.** `12:42` **You**

Sok I feel younger so there is that


**215.** `12:42` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Exactly


**216.** `12:43` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

It‚Äôs funny because I‚Äôve been thinking about the stark honesty thing a bit


**217.** `12:43` **You**

Why?


**218.** `12:43` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

I‚Äôm like ‚Äúshould I work on that?‚Äù Lol


**219.** `12:43` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

So when Andrew and I met, we talked online because he was in Dallas for a few months like three months and then we met in real life\.


**220.** `12:43` **You**

Mer yes there are certain things you don‚Äôt say\.


**221.** `12:44` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

The first thing I said to him was‚Ä¶ wait for it‚Ä¶\.


**222.** `12:44` **You**

I thought you‚Äôd be taller


**223.** `12:44` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Exactly and he hates it so much\. Brings it up all the time\.


**224.** `12:44` **You**

lol


**225.** `12:44` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Like a few times a year for sure


**226.** `12:44` **You**

I know you too well already


**227.** `12:44` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Did I tell you that story?


**228.** `12:44` **You**

No


**229.** `12:44` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Oh my God, good guess


**230.** `12:44` **You**

Nope not a guess


**231.** `12:45` **You**

You said you like tall guys or big guys or whatever


**232.** `12:45` **You**

So was kind of logic leap


**233.** `12:45` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

I guess still good though


**234.** `12:45` **You**

But yeah there are still things you shouldn‚Äôt say especially to a guy


**235.** `12:45` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

lol


**236.** `12:45` **You**

And the fact that you don‚Äôt like to lie


**237.** `12:45` **You**

Makes it so much worse


**238.** `12:46` **You**

Because again it is now about as much as you don‚Äôt say as what you do


**239.** `12:46` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Correct


**240.** `12:46` **You**

So even for me I have started thinking more about the questions I ask and the things I say to you


**241.** `12:46` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

I think that is most people though


**242.** `12:46` **You**

Because like the other night it went all fucked Jo


**243.** `12:46` **You**

Up


**244.** `12:46` **You**

Not most people


**245.** `12:46` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Hahah


**246.** `12:46` **You**

Most people lie


**247.** `12:46` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

‚ÄúMost‚Äù


**248.** `12:46` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

I‚Äôm not sure about that


**249.** `12:46` **You**

A little or a lot


**250.** `12:47` **You**

But nearly everyone does


**251.** `12:47` **You**

Especially about certain things


**252.** `12:47` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

I guess I don‚Äôt see the point I know I‚Äôve said that before, but it‚Äôs true


**253.** `12:48` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

I will work on my lying


**254.** `12:48` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

KIDDING


**255.** `12:48` **You**

I am going to show you


**256.** `12:50` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Please don‚Äôt\. Lol


**257.** `12:50` **You**

Oh no


**258.** `12:50` **You**

It‚Äôs on


**259.** `12:51` **You**

Informing nsfw gpt query


**260.** `12:51` **You**

I actually had to re query it\.\. because the nsfw was SOOOOO nsfw\.


**261.** `12:51` **You**

I was like holy shit


**262.** `12:52` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Wait explain that what were you querying


**263.** `12:53` **You**

Stark honesty


**264.** `12:53` **You**

And the impacts


**265.** `12:53` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

But how is that not safe for work I don‚Äôt get it


**266.** `12:53` **You**

I will show you what I asked


**267.** `12:53` **You**

Because I told it you can respond in a nsfw manner


**268.** `12:54` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

lol oh


**269.** `12:54` **You**

More realistic


**270.** `13:07` **You**

Man gpt is dirty I had to tone it back a lot


**271.** `13:07` **You**

Ok you ready?


**272.** `13:07` **You**

Stark honesty no no‚Äôs


**273.** `13:08` **You**

Reaction: üòÇ from Meredith Lamb
Or did you shut off your phone because you don‚Äôt want to read lol


**274.** `13:09` **You**

Now you haven‚Äôt nor would I think you would go into this detail, even really drunk\.\.  well maybe‚Ä¶\.  Anyhow this is why people lie\.
1\. Past Encounters
1\.	‚ÄúI‚Äôve been with maybe six guys‚Äîone could go on for nearly an hour, another wrapped up in ten minutes but always hit my sweet spot\.‚Äù
- Ripple: You might wonder if you‚Äôre ‚Äúquick enough‚Äù or ‚Äúlasting long enough\.‚Äù
2\.	‚ÄúThere was a weekend when I saw two different people in one night‚Äîlike clockwork\.‚Äù
- Ripple: You could feel like you‚Äôre competing on sheer frequency, not connection\.
3\.	‚ÄúI once had someone who never ran out of steam‚Äîkept going until sunrise\.‚Äù
- Ripple: You may stress about matching that all\-night stamina instead of just enjoying yourselves\.
4\.	‚ÄúAnother guy was‚Ä¶ well\-equipped and knew exactly when to slow down\.‚Äù
- Ripple: You could start second\-guessing whether your own size or pacing measures up\.
‚∏ª
2\. Expressions of Love & Deep Affection
1\.	‚ÄúHe wrote me love letters every week‚Äîpages of how much he adored me\.‚Äù
- Ripple: You might feel your own words fall short by comparison\.
2\.	‚ÄúHe used to whisper ‚ÄòI love you‚Äô for minutes on end‚Äîlike he never ran out of ways to say it\.‚Äù
- Ripple: You could worry your ‚ÄúI love you‚Äù sounds too routine\.
3\.	‚ÄúHe planned surprise photo shoots of us‚Äîsaid he wanted to freeze every moment\.‚Äù
- Ripple: You may feel pressure to make every date ‚Äúphoto\-worthy\.‚Äù
4\.	‚ÄúWe‚Äôd spend entire afternoons just holding hands in the park, not saying a word\.‚Äù
- Ripple: You might question if a quick hug across the kitchen is ‚Äúenough\.‚Äù
‚∏ª
3\. Passing Fantasies
1\.	‚ÄúSometimes I daydream about a night that just never ends‚Äîno clocks, no plans\.‚Äù
- Ripple: You could feel self\-conscious if you can‚Äôt keep up an all\-nighter anymore\.
2\.	‚ÄúI picture us stumbling into a hidden cabin, just the two of us, no schedules\.‚Äù
- Ripple: He may feel excluded from that spontaneous escape you‚Äôve already played out in your head\.
3\.	‚ÄúI imagine a partner who can read my mind‚Äîknowing exactly where to touch first\.‚Äù
- Ripple: You might worry he‚Äôs not tuned into your unspoken cues\.
4\.	‚ÄúI‚Äôve thought about us finding a secret beach and dancing under the stars\.‚Äù
- Ripple: He may hesitate to plan anything, fearing it won‚Äôt match your mental movie\.
‚∏ª
4\. Adventures We Can‚Äôt Recapture in Our Late 40s
1\.	‚ÄúRemember that backpacking trip through Southeast Asia? We lived out of a backpack for months\.‚Äù
- Ripple: You might compare any future trip to that free\-spirited binge\.
2\.	‚ÄúWe once road\-tripped cross\-country with nothing but a map and a tank of gas\.‚Äù
- Ripple: You may feel your weekend getaway plans look tame beside that epic journey\.
3\.	‚ÄúWe danced until dawn at that festival, rain or shine‚Äîno care in the world\.‚Äù
- Ripple: You could feel your Friday night karaoke now doesn‚Äôt quite measure up\.
4\.	‚ÄúWe hitchhiked to Vegas on a whim‚Äîpulled off a last\-minute wedding\.‚Äù
- Ripple: You might worry your anniversary dinner reservation seems dull by comparison\.
‚∏ª
Heads\-up: Even lighthearted ‚Äúoops‚Äù remarks can leave you wondering where you really stand\. A quick ‚ÄúBut I love you just as you are‚Äù right after helps keep things warm, not competitive\.


**275.** `13:10` **You**

Welcome to the world of an insecure guy even the ones that say they aren‚Äôt always are\.


**276.** `13:12` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

WOW


**277.** `13:12` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

holy ‚Ä¶ my head does not go there at all\. That was very educational


**278.** `13:16` **You**

it doesn't right now


**279.** `13:17` **You**

>
educational lol\.\. you should have seen the first iteration\.\.

*üí¨ Reply*

**280.** `13:17` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

I‚Äôm sure I could‚Äôve handled it


**281.** `13:19` **You**

this was the 1st one\.\. not pasting anymore\. lol
1\. Graphic Sexual Details & Past Encounters
Examples you might blurt out:
‚ÄúThat time I fucked three guys in one night‚Äîlet me tell you every position they topped me in\.‚Äù
‚ÄúMy ex and I used to have wild role\-play: I‚Äôd be the schoolgirl, he‚Äôd be the headmaster‚Ä¶‚Äù
‚ÄúI only orgasm when they do X in this exact way, not how you‚Äôre doing it\.‚Äù
Likely Outcome:
Jealousy PTSD: He‚Äôll replay those scenes in his head, convinced he can‚Äôt compete\.
Performance Anxiety: He‚Äôll freeze up, fearing he‚Äôll disappoint you or measure up to those ex\-standards\.
Emotional Shutdown: Instead of closeness, you get awkward distance‚Äîbecause who wants a running commentary on your partner‚Äôs past pornographic highlights?


**282.** `13:19` **You**

anyhow\.\. does that help with stark honesty?  and why I say everyone lies\.\. and why I am now being a bit more careful\. lol


**283.** `13:20` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Yes that helps


**284.** `13:21` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Not sure I‚Äôd say anything like that, but I‚Äôve obviously said some stuff that has had an impact so ugh‚Ä¶


**285.** `13:21` **You**

or not said\.\. so confusing eh\.


**286.** `13:21` **You**

relationships and communications are tough\.


**287.** `13:21` **You**

it was really hard for J and I she used to call me out on it all the time


**288.** `13:22` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Call you out on what exactly?


**289.** `13:23` **You**

I was more open / honest with her in the beginning\.\. kind of like you have been\.\. maybe not quite so much\.\. but J always was and remains very insecure about a lot of things\.\. I had much more experience than her in a lot of areas\.\. she new a bit about my past\.\. new some people I had dated\.


**290.** `13:23` **You**

It made her feel inadequate


**291.** `13:24` **You**

like she couldn't measure up to previous experiences etc\.


**292.** `13:24` **You**

the tricky part is when you actually want to be honest\.\. like I can say as of yet I have not lied to you at all about any of the feelings I have about anything\.


**293.** `13:25` **You**

sometimes I omit if you don't ask generally on the negative feelings\.  But as you said that isn't lying per se\.


**294.** `13:25` **You**

I just had to tailor my approach to her\.\. she was who she was\.\. and I didn't want her to feel bad\.


**295.** `13:26` **You**

but I still always tried to be honest


**296.** `13:26` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

You strike me as pretty honest


**297.** `13:26` **You**

I am\.\. but I also care about how what I say makes people feel\.


**298.** `13:27` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Maybe too much sometimes?


**299.** `13:27` **You**

and even then I think about what I am not saying as well\.


**300.** `13:27` **You**

Not for people I care about\.\.


**301.** `13:27` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

You think so much\.


**302.** `13:27` **You**

I can have an impact on people\.\. it can be good or bad\.\. I would prefer good\.


**303.** `13:28` **You**

I can be a lot more honest with you\.\. because you have kind of drawn you comfort lines for me\.


**304.** `13:28` **You**

you are not as insecure


**305.** `13:29` **You**

Anyhow\.\. you should go do your own research\.\. and pick the approach you want to take\.\. honesty is very important to you\.\. and I appreciate that\.  You be you just don't be surprised at how some people, not all, will receive that kind of honesty in certain situations or on specific topics


**306.** `13:30` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

I am insecure too‚Ä¶ however, I don‚Äôt let that lead my life\. Just push it aside when I can\.


**307.** `13:32` **You**

Reaction: üòÇ from Meredith Lamb
Some people have more insecurities\.\. for some people those insecurities are directly related to their relationship\.\. things that I shared above are really issues for men\.\. well for those that aren't selfish fuckwads\.  Cause they don't care about anything\.\.


**308.** `13:32` **You**

And you have a coping mechanism\.\. some people cannot compartmentalize like you do\.\. or rationalize\.\. which is how I try to deal with my issues\.


**309.** `13:33` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

I haven‚Äôt been dealing with a lot of insecurities lol

*üí¨ Reply*

**310.** `13:33` **You**

**314.** `13:34` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

I just spent the last 15 years


**315.** `13:34` **You**

yeah I get it\.


**316.** `13:34` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

With an insecure person, however a big ego also


**317.** `13:35` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

So I don‚Äôt really think they‚Äôre true insecurities I think it‚Äôs just whining and complaining


**318.** `13:35` **You**

Reaction: üòÇ from Meredith Lamb
mmmmm\.


**319.** `13:36` **You**

Yeah\.\. I mean you can feel that way\.\. but it probably isn't ever going to be well received\. just saying\.\. I don't know him at all\.\. he seems like an asshole to me\.  But I guarantee he has insecurities\.\. and they are real\.\. he hides it with ego and arrogance and exerting control\.  And there is more to this\.\. but I won't share that part\.


**320.** `13:38` **You**

Actually I will share\.\. I think he wanted to have sex with you so much because 1\. you are great at it, 2\. it gave him a connection to you that he couldn't get emotionally perhaps, 3\. I think you might characterize it as \- because your body has been good to you, it made him feel good about himself\.  Does that make sense\.\. you can ask gpt\.


**321.** `13:39` **You**

I think J wanted the same thing for the same reason\.\. but I was unwilling\.\. it felt dishonest and I didn't want to do that\.


**322.** `13:40` **You**

anyhow\.\. you have probably had enough of this topic now\.\. lol\.\.


**323.** `13:40` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

>
Yes makes sense but he was also a person with a high sex drive\. I think those exist more than others\.

*üí¨ Reply*

**324.** `13:41` **You**

>
the drive was to feel those things I shared\.\.

*üí¨ Reply*

**325.** `13:41` **You**

some people generally get those feelings from sex\.\. because they cannot elsewhere


**326.** `13:41` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

And yah I know he has lots of insecurities\. He‚Äôs full of them\. But then he has this whole other side\. It is a really odd confusing combination\.


**327.** `13:41` **You**

everyone has sides\.\. so do I


**328.** `13:42` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Still surprised by this but getting it more \.\.

*üí¨ Reply*

**329.** `13:43` **You**

explain or ask\.\.


**330.** `13:43` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

OK, so I couldn‚Äôt find an app to download the text messages\. The apps are all annoying and many of them require screenshots\. Do you know how many screenshots it would take? Oh my God


**331.** `13:43` **You**

mmm the easiest way to do it is on a mac\.\. so not likely to happen\.

My kids have Mac‚Äôs


**333.** `13:44` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Mac and Maelle


**334.** `13:44` **You**

you could do it on those but you need to log in under your apple profile


**335.** `13:44` **You**

and sync


**336.** `13:44` **You**

and then you could do it easier


**337.** `13:44` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

So I‚Äôve never used a Mac is it easy?

I mean sure\.\. I am sure gpt could help\.


**347.** `13:52` **You**

I hope this didn't bother you at all\.\. I know you are better with processing this shit than I am\.\. but it was a bit of a firehose\.  Again if you ever have questions\.\. please ask\.\. on anything\.


**348.** `13:52` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Didn‚Äôt bother me at all\.


**349.** `13:53` **You**

Honestly I love you just the way you are\.\. and if you didn't change anything I wouldn't care\.\. I just need to adapt a bit\.


**350.** `13:54` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Ugh, I don‚Äôt like hearing that you have to adapt\.


**351.** `13:54` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

That actually bothers me


**352.** `13:54` **You**

everyone adapts Mer


**353.** `13:54` **You**

always


**354.** `13:55` **You**

it is just how much and how fast\.\. sometimes people cannot\.\. it is too much of change from where they are comfortable\.


**355.** `13:55` **You**

adapting doesn't change who I am\.


**356.** `13:55` **You**

it just changes how I deal and process\.


**357.** `13:56` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Are you comfortable right now though?


**358.** `13:56` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

I am not lieing

about what

am I comfortable with what

If you shared all that shit I gpt'd with me\.\. lol you asking if I would be comfortable with that?


**363.** `13:57` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

When you answer my question ‚Ä¶ just comfortable with where we are at and how I am\. You have learned we are very different and are you comfortable with that


**364.** `13:59` **You**

Reaction: ‚ù§Ô∏è from Meredith Lamb
yeah\.\. those are just idiosyncrasies\.\. at your core\.\. who YOU are\.\. that is who I am desperately in love with\.  The more I learn the more real you become\.\. and no one likes everything about someone else\.\. that would be a massive lie\.  But when you ask if I am comfortable\.\. I haven't stopped thinking about you\.\. through the good or bad moments\.\. I have never stopped wanting to be with you through the good or the bad moments\.\. I have never stopped about thinking about us forever in the good or the bad moments\.\. and I KNOW there will be more bad moments\.\. I am just banking on a landslide of good moments to bury them\.


**365.** `14:02` **You**

Reaction: üòÇ from Meredith Lamb
Am I comfortable sitting across from 10 glasses in Meredith\.\. I either need to be right there with you\.\.\. lol\.\. I need to put on some armor\.\. or I need to make you quickly forget about wanting to tell me any stories in the first place\.\. all of which I am fairly certain I can accomplish\.\. I also don't think future stories are going to affect me as much\.  But again\.\. to be clear\.\. some things on this list\.\. yeah can always be impactful\.

**408.** `14:29` **You**

I‚Äôve always felt a pull to you that I can‚Äôt explain\.

I think it was the fact that I found you beautiful on the outside and on the inside\.\. and your smile would melt me into a puddle\.


**413.** `14:31` **You**

I had to be really careful around you\.\. I remember that\.\. I didn't want to flirt at all\.\. I wanted to not let on anything\.

Option 2: The "Print to PDF" Workaround \(Free\)
If you don't want to pay for software and only need to save a few important conversations, you can use the Mac's built\-in Print function to create a PDF\. From there, you can extract the text\.
Pros: Free, preserves the visual layout of the conversation\.
Cons: Must be done one conversation at a time, which is very time\-consuming for a large archive\.
Step\-by\-Step Instructions:
Open the Messages app on your Mac\.
Select the single conversation you want to export\.
In the menu bar at the top of the screen, click File > Print\.\.\.
A print dialog box will appear\. In the bottom\-left corner, click the PDF dropdown menu\.
Select Save as PDF\.
Name the file and choose where to save it\. You now have a PDF copy of that conversation\.
To get this into a text file:
Open the newly created PDF file in the Preview app\.
Click and drag to select all the text, or press Cmd \+ A\.
Copy the text \(Cmd \+ C\)\.
Open the TextEdit app, and in the menu bar, select Format > Make Plain Text\.
Paste the text \(Cmd \+ V\) and save your file\.
Note: The formatting \(like who said what\) can be a bit jumbled with this copy\-paste method from a PDF\.


**553.** `16:28` **You**

that should be able to work for every exchange we have ever had\.\.


**554.** `16:28` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Well, this is what I will do if I can get the messages synced and on my iCloud, but it‚Äôs not happening so


**555.** `16:28` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

I was never backing up my messages to my iCloud


**556.** `16:28` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

**557.** `16:29` **You**

you are the only one that has access to that account right?


**558.** `16:29` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Yeah


**559.** `16:29` **You**

kk when you are done\.\. log out of her comp as well\.


**560.** `16:29` **You**

like out of your apple account


**561.** `16:30` **You**

That is a very common and frustrating problem\. The iCloud sync process can be finicky and often appears to freeze, especially if you have a large message history\.
Let's work through a direct, step\-by\-step troubleshooting process, starting with the simplest fixes\.
\#\#\# \*\*Checklist: The Quick Fixes\*\*
Before doing anything drastic, let's ensure the fundamentals are in place\. These solve the problem more often than you'd think\.
\* \*\*Check Apple's Servers:\*\* First, verify that the issue isn't on Apple's end\. Visit their \[System Status page\]\(https://www\.apple\.com/ca/support/systemstatus/\) and ensure "iCloud Mail" and "Messages" have a green circle\. If they are yellow or red, the only solution is to wait for Apple to fix it\.
\* \*\*Check Your Internet:\*\* The sync requires a stable Wi\-Fi connection on \*\*both\*\* your iPhone and your Mac\. A weak or intermittent signal can cause it to stall\.
\* \*\*Plug Both Devices In:\*\* The sync process is energy\-intensive\. Both iOS and macOS can pause background activities like this to save power\. Plug both your iPhone and your Mac into their chargers\.
\* \*\*Check Your iCloud Storage:\*\* If your iCloud account is full, the sync will fail\.
\* On your iPhone: Go to \*\*Settings > \[Your Name\] > iCloud\*\*\.
\* On your Mac: Go to \*\*System Settings > \[Your Name\] > iCloud\*\*\.
\* If the storage bar is full, you will need to free up space for the sync to complete\.
\* \*\*Be Patient:\*\* How long has it been frozen? If you have years of messages and photos, the initial sync can take many hours, or even overnight\. On your Mac's Messages app, look at the bottom\-left corner\. If it says "Downloading Messages from iCloud\.\.\." it is still working, even if the progress bar hasn't moved\.
\#\#\# \*\*Step 2: The "Forced Nudge"\*\*
If the basics are all good, the next step is to give the system a push to restart the process\.
1\.  \*\*Restart Both Devices:\*\* A simple restart is the most effective troubleshooting step for a reason\.
\* Shut down your Mac and restart it\.
\* Completely power off your iPhone and turn it back on\.
2\.  \*\*Manually Trigger Sync:\*\*
\* On your Mac, open the \*\*Messages\*\* app\.
\* In the menu bar, go to \*\*Messages > Settings > iMessage\*\*\.
\* Click the \*\*"Sync Now"\*\* button\. This should force it to re\-check the sync status\.
\#\#\# \*\*Step 3: The "Hard Reset" of the Sync\*\*
If it's still frozen after a restart, the next step is to toggle the service off and on\. This forces a complete re\-authentication with Apple's servers\.
\*\*Important:\*\* Do these steps in the exact order listed\.
1\.  \*\*On your Mac:\*\*
\* Go to \*\*Messages > Settings > iMessage\*\*\.
\* \*\*Uncheck\*\* the box next to "Enable Messages in iCloud\."
\* Close the Messages app completely \(\`Cmd \+ Q\`\)\.
2\.  \*\*On your iPhone:\*\*
\* Go to \*\*Settings > \[Your Name\] > iCloud\*\*\.
\* Tap \*\*Show All\*\*, then tap \*\*Messages\*\*\.
\* Toggle \*\*OFF\*\* "Sync this iPhone\."
\* A popup will appear\. Choose \*\*"Disable and Download Messages\."\*\* This is safe; it just ensures your messages remain on your phone\.
3\.  \*\*Wait:\*\* Leave both devices like this for at least 10\-15 minutes\.
4\.  \*\*Re\-Enable \(iPhone First\):\*\*
\* On your iPhone, go back to the same setting and toggle \*\*ON\*\* "Sync this iPhone\."
\* Wait for it to finish its initial connection\.
5\.  \*\*Re\-Enable \(Mac Second\):\*\*
\* On your Mac, open Messages and go back to \*\*Messages > Settings > iMessage\*\*\.
\* \*\*Check\*\* the box to "Enable Messages in iCloud" and click \*\*"Sync Now\."\*\*
Now, let the process run again\. It will start from the beginning, but this often clears whatever was causing the freeze\.

**573.** `16:35` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

lol


**574.** `16:35` **You**

Ouch


**575.** `16:35` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

I don‚Äôt want you to be disappointed


**576.** `16:36` **You**

so by lowering expectations to the bottom I won't be\.\.\. lol


**577.** `16:36` **You**

well I have a counter for you


**578.** `16:37` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Exactly

*üí¨ Reply*

**579.** `16:37` **You**

Part of my sharing that was to also share with you some of the outcomes from that kind of sharing\.\. so let me manage your expectations :\)  don't be surprised if I react exactly like chatgpt describes if some of that stuff gets fired my way\. lol


**580.** `16:37` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Oh my God, I would never say stuff like that


**581.** `16:38` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Drunk or not


**582.** `16:38` **You**

mmmm hmmm


**583.** `16:38` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

I really don‚Äôt think I would say anything like that honestly


**584.** `16:38` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

That was pretty intense


**585.** `16:38` **You**

not explicitly\.


**586.** `16:38` **You**

I will tell you the last change i made to the prompt,


**587.** `16:39` **You**

because even drunk\.\. you almost never come out straight and say something lol\.\. you infer and suggest without being specific\.


**588.** `16:39` **You**

so I asked it to apply that approach


**589.** `16:40` **You**

so I don't think you would say those things exactly no\.\. but you might infer, suggest or reference\.\. drunk only\.\. hey you were the one that was concerned about stark honesty to begin with\.


**590.** `16:40` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Is there something I HAVEN‚ÄôT answered that bothers you still? Or just in the moment


**591.** `16:41` **You**

what does just in the moment mean?


**592.** `16:41` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Does it bother you in the moment and then you forget about it? Like in the moment when we are talking I mean


**593.** `16:42` **You**

I mean it depends on all kinds of things\.\. context for one\.\. are we together or apart etc\.\.  I tend to forget more when we are together\.\. except really stark things LOL\.


**594.** `16:43` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Fair enough


**595.** `16:43` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

lol


**596.** `16:44` **You**

I know what you are digging for\.\. and we aren't going there tonight\. üòù


**597.** `16:44` **You**

Had a good night last night, a good day today\.\. not going to ruin it now\.


**598.** `16:45` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

I am digging\!


**599.** `16:46` **You**

I know\.\. but some of this shit you don't need or want to know\.\. you have TONS of that kind of stuff you don't want me digging into\.\. so better to maybe not dig?


**600.** `16:46` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

>
I meant to say, I am not digging sorry

*üí¨ Reply*

**601.** `16:46` **You**

lol


**602.** `16:46` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Honestly, I am not


**603.** `16:47` **You**

>
sorry I must have misread the ALL CAPS rofl\.

*üí¨ Reply*

**604.** `16:47` **You**

typo probably\.\. oops caps lock


**605.** `16:48` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

It was a serious question you say I avoid or whatever and I was just curious if there was something that I was avoiding, that was sitting with you happy if not cause I don‚Äôt think I avoid regularly


**606.** `16:48` **You**

So you know how I told you many / most people tell white lies\.\.  they learn to do it, it becomes natural and then they don't notice it\.


**607.** `16:50` **You**

That is you with avoid / omit\.\. although I might need to chalk it up to just not reading\.  But yeah you avoid shit all the time\.  About as much as other people tell the little white lies I would say\.  Omit too\.\. like if the question didn't explicitly ask something but it was basic to infer that is what it meant\.\. you will jump through the loop hole and run\.  It's fine\.\. I like chasing most of the time\.


**608.** `16:52` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

lol


**609.** `16:52` **You**

sometimes I can see you thinking about it


**610.** `16:52` **You**

other times you just do it\.


**611.** `16:53` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Maybe you just ask hard questions


**612.** `16:53` **You**

hard or easy\.\.


**613.** `16:53` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Ever think about that?


**614.** `16:53` **You**

you look for traps


**615.** `16:53` **You**

best way to characterize


**616.** `16:53` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Traps? Lol what?


**617.** `16:53` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

No


**618.** `16:53` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

I do not


**619.** `16:53` **You**

yeah you look for traps\.\. I don't know how else to say


**620.** `16:54` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

You are being goofy now


**621.** `16:54` **You**

I wouldn't say tentative, I would say cautious\.


**622.** `16:54` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

>
They are different\!

*üí¨ Reply*

**623.** `16:54` **You**

the distinction there is pretty fine\.\. and that is an innocent one\.\. like nothing but you like to be very specific about some things\.


**624.** `16:54` **You**

but could care less about others


**625.** `16:55` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Key Difference:
- Tentative is more about being unsure or not yet decided\.
- Cautious is about being careful and avoiding risk, even if you‚Äôre sure of your intent\.


**626.** `16:56` **You**

I already did that


**627.** `16:56` **You**

LOL


**628.** `16:56` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

lol


**629.** `16:56` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

The exact difference I meant\!


**630.** `16:56` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

I wasn‚Äôt undecided


**631.** `16:56` **You**

ok ok\.\. it's fine you think what you want\.\. I can only share what I observe


**632.** `16:56` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

But I was worried about work, your marriage, etc etc etc


**633.** `16:57` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Reaction: üëç from Scott Hicks
So cautious üòá


**634.** `16:57` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

You have to let me win sometimes


**635.** `16:58` **You**

I mean you are right about tentaive and cautious\.\. I can give you that win\.


**636.** `16:59` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

k thanks üôÇ


**637.** `16:59` **You**

np\.\. you earned it\.\.\.


**638.** `17:02` **You**

but on the rest of the stuff I am right\.\. üòùüòù


**639.** `17:04` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Okay but you may need to prove it at some point\. :\)


**640.** `17:05` **You**

\.\.\.\.\. I will have to find something safe\.


**641.** `17:06` **You**

I mean I did already prove this once


**642.** `17:06` **You**

a while back


**643.** `17:06` **You**

you actually recognized it


**644.** `17:06` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

**645.** `17:06` **You**

**646.** `17:06` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

**758.** `20:58` **You**

I reformatted the text I get into something a bit more readable


**759.** `20:58` **You**

I also broke out all of the files into days\.


**760.** `20:59` **You**

So I can take these and put them on a Google drive


**761.** `20:59` **You**

and then gemini can access them all from there


**762.** `21:01` **You**

now I am ocr'ing your doc


**763.** `21:02` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Ocr


**764.** `21:02` **You**

Optical Character Recognition


**765.** `21:02` **You**

basically it identifies text in pictures


**766.** `21:02` **You**

that is step 1


**767.** `21:02` **You**

of a few


**768.** `21:03` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

You are hardcore\.


**769.** `21:03` **You**

no\.\. not really\.\. I am too distracted to be hardcore


**770.** `21:04` **You**

brb need food


**771.** `21:04` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

I‚Äôm going to shower


**772.** `21:14` **You**

kk let me think about that for a bit\.\.  you know\.\. I can help you do that sometime\.\.\. I kind of expected an invitation and none was forthcoming\. üò≠


**773.** `21:22` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

lol


**774.** `21:23` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Eventually maybe?


**775.** `21:23` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

\(Did you like the maybe on the end?\)


**776.** `21:23` **You**

mmmm\.\.\. I just think you would be missing out on fun time\.\. your call\.


**777.** `21:27` **You**

fun time does seem like a while ago now that I think about it


**778.** `21:27` **You**

**783.** `21:28` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

**787.** `21:33` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

It is not something that is keeping me up at night\. It is just there\.


**788.** `21:34` **You**

ok\.\. well if it bothers just tell me how to stay within my lane\.\. and I will be happy to try to make you more comfortable\.


**789.** `21:35` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Stay within your lane lol


**790.** `21:35` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Huh


**791.** `21:35` **You**

I mean don't do things that make you feel uncomfortable\.


**792.** `21:35` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Ahhhh


**793.** `21:35` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

You don‚Äôt do that


**794.** `21:36` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôd be uncomfortable with you but it has been like a short time so I‚Äôm still getting used to things yunnno


**795.** `21:38` **You**

I think I know\.\. but I am not sure\.\. lol so sure\.\. let's just say I do


**796.** `21:38` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Haha


**797.** `21:39` **You**

I mean let's say there have been kind of some guidelines I am supposed to stay within


**798.** `21:39` **You**

so if those were to relax then sure more things to get used to


**799.** `21:39` **You**

maybe?


**800.** `21:39` **You**

lol


**801.** `21:39` **You**

trying here\.\. rofl


**802.** `21:41` **You**

you ok there


**803.** `21:41` **You**

a lot of typing or deleting or both or start stopping


**804.** `21:42` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

It‚Äôs pretty simple\. I have a complicated relationship with my weight like most women \(many factors contribute to it obviously\) but in my 20s/30s it wasn‚Äôt a thing as much\. Since kids it has always been a thing‚Ä¶ when you are with someone throughout all that, it is less of a thing\. Then all of a sudden you are split up and with someone and it is just a consideration to navigate that wasn‚Äôt AS much there before in the past\.
All that to say, I am figuring it out and will be fine


**805.** `21:42` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

lol


**806.** `21:43` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

But shower‚Ä¶\. Right now‚Ä¶\. Feels uh ‚Ä¶\.\. uncomfortable for sure


**807.** `21:43` **You**

kk but it didn't bother you and then it did?


**808.** `21:43` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Didn‚Äôt bother me when?

*üí¨ Reply*

**809.** `21:43` **You**

just because it is me\.\. there is nothing daunting over here\.\. lol


**810.** `21:44` **You**

**811.** `21:44` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

**830.** `21:48` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

I think you like to be challenged lol


**831.** `21:48` **You**

mmmm  I like to be engaged\.


**832.** `21:49` **You**

not so much a contest\.\. against one another\.\.


**833.** `21:49` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Not fun sometimes?


**834.** `21:49` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Haha


**838.** `21:50` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

if we are being competitive\.\. I would say I am more open than you atm\.


**840.** `21:50` **You**

and I don't think you were ready for that\.


**841.** `21:51` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

I know, well it is like you got permission and then you just wanted to go full force in one day


**842.** `21:51` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

That wasn‚Äôt really what I meant when I raised it lol


**843.** `21:51` **You**

I mean a\) permission \- more like a request\.\. b\) that wasn't even close to full force


**844.** `21:51` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

And honestly I don‚Äôt mind


**845.** `21:52` **You**

but we can slow it way down if you want


**846.** `21:52` **You**

like turtle speed


**847.** `21:52` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

I was asking it to consider the conversation\.\. consider the questions being asked, and the answers being given or not given\.  Consider literally and inferentially what someone might be looking for versus receiving\.


**914.** `22:38` **You**

Consider the responses and whether or not they are directly related, not related at all, or vague in general\.
