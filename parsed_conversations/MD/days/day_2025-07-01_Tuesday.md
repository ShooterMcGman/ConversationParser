Careful there\. Lot of ghost cars out today


**002.** `15:08` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

**003.** `15:40` **You**

Well safe drive\.\.
I am home‚Ä¶ back to reality\.\.
Sigh lol


**004.** `15:51` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Same just got home and back to it\. Empty house though fortunately\. I haven‚Äôt had a weekend that good in forever I don‚Äôt think\. ü§î ü§îü§î Can‚Äôt think of one in years ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è


**005.** `15:55` **You**

Reaction: ‚ù§Ô∏è from Meredith Lamb
I never have\.  Nothing that even comes close\. No one comes close to you Mer\.\. so makes sense\. Love you ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è


**006.** `19:17` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Salmon in the oven and lying watching tv with a heating pad on my abdomen\. I might have something internal bruising lol ü§™


**007.** `19:19` **You**

ahh fack Mer\.\. we will tone that way back\.\. I am really really sorry\.\.\. üòü


**008.** `19:20` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

I‚Äôm good it is honestly a little humorous


**009.** `19:20` **You**

that was definitely not my intent\.\. really no clue\.


**010.** `19:20` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Reaction: ‚ù§Ô∏è from Scott Hicks
All worth it üòãüòç


**011.** `19:21` **You**

still\.\. I will calm it down\.\. or something\.\. will figure it out\.


**012.** `19:22` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

No \- we maybe just don‚Äôt go constantly for hours and days on end all the time lol I am probably more to blame than u haha


**013.** `19:22` **You**

yeah it was a little out of hand\.\. perhaps\.


**014.** `19:23` **You**

Sorry\.\. again that hasn't quite happened to me\.\. at least not that way, that intense, etc\.\.


**015.** `19:25` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Is your house relatively drama free?


**016.** `19:27` **You**

Yeah\.\. honestly straight to basement doing laundry, doing a bit of AI work\.\. show on TV\.\. still you know\.\.\.\. meh


**017.** `19:28` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

I napped lol


**018.** `19:28` **You**

yeah I am fine\.\. I want to be able to go to bed early\.\.\. so I can get back on my routine\.


**019.** `19:31` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

It might take me a day before I get back at it lol


**020.** `19:31` **You**

No I have to get back into my routine\.\. quickly\.\. it will help me re\-adapt back to this situation\.


**021.** `19:48` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Yeah will be an interesting week to see the aftermath\. Maybe the time together will make it easier this week


**022.** `19:55` **You**

For me I am not sure how I will feel this week, maybe it will make it easier for you\.  I mean\.\. am I more sure of us\.\. I have been for a while, I don't question that in the least anymore\.  As you said, I haven't loved anyone quite like I love you, or nearly as much, and I feel that from you as well\.  I have never been more clear or sure of what I want, or of what I am willing to give, than I am with you\.


**023.** `19:57` **You**

I think this will come down to me being able to manage time apart\.\. find distractions stay busy\.  I don't have nearly as many obligations or things to keep me busy as you do\.\. so I will need to find something, especially for when Maddie is gone\.\. then it will just be me by myself\.  It will make it easier on both of us if I can find something to fill my time so that I am not well\.\. always thinking about you\.\.


**024.** `20:00` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

There is always work to fill your time üòú\. I‚Äôm honestly not expecting this week to be ‚Äúeasier‚Äù but who knows\. I certainly have a lot of logistical crap to organize this week and next which will keep me distracted‚Ä¶\. somewhat\. It does feel like such a huge waste that we can‚Äôt just be together but patience\.


**025.** `20:02` **You**

I know\.\. I am being patient\.\. just would like to fill my time with something meaningful and enjoyable in the times we cannot be together \- which will be a lot for a number of years\.\. so it is kind of important for me to figure this out right\.


**026.** `20:06` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

‚Äúa lot‚Äù üò≠


**027.** `20:08` **You**

well it will be right?  I mean 6 years until all kids in university\.\. at least one week on and off with kids\.\. I mean at some point there is the possibility that we could live together\.\. I would be all for that sooner than later\.\. but there is a LOT to consider\.\. and much more on your side of the fence before that happens\.


**028.** `20:10` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

It won‚Äôt be 6 years that‚Äôs for damn sure


**029.** `20:18` **You**

Yeah I know\.\. but you know what I mean\.\. this is early on\.\. but feels very different which is what makes it so awkward\.  Look while I do care about the situation\.\. I don't care about it more than I care about you\.\. this could proceed just like this \(bit of a planning shitshow nightmare\)  for the next two years, trying to squeak out times to see each other \(I know it won't once everyone \(not work\) knows\)  but for the sake of argument\.\. I would take the "shitshow" scenario for the rest of my life \- because there aren't any other alternatives or choices for me to make\.\. I have made mine\.  Again, I think the important thing will be for me to build some kind of disposable life\.\. I don't know what you want to call it\.\. but something for when you aren't around\.\. because I don't have family or friends here, and honestly while I think you worry that I will make the wrong kind of friends\.\. or something about oats ffs\.\. I think it will just be easier for both of us if I am a little self sufficient in the keeping busy and being happy on my own part of my life that is coming\.


**030.** `20:21` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

‚ÄúSomething about oats ffs‚Äù üòÇ


**031.** `20:21` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

LOL


**032.** `20:21` **You**

that is all you\.\. and is all nonsense


**033.** `20:22` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

So funny \(and a real thing btw \- the saying exists for a reason\)


**034.** `20:24` **You**

I never ascribed anything to what I did when I was younger beyond trying to fill a void\.\. I wasn't happy\.\. companionship gave me a bit of a purpose\.\. made me happy, while making someone else happy\.\. but it was very fleeting mostly\.\. there and gone again\.\. then rinse and repeat\.  Doing what I did wasn't about notches, or sowing seeds, it was about connecting with someone, and feeling connected\.\. at the time I just didn't want a relationship\.  If you were not in the picture, I am not sure how this would have progressed, but it definitely wouldn't be me turning into a 20 year old idiot and sleeping with a bunch of people\.


**035.** `20:25` **You**

I feel connected with you more than anyone else ever\.\. since even when we started chatting and kind of realizing what we believed we had, and were walking into together\.\. I haven't so much as thought about another woman in anyway remotely resembling interest\.


**036.** `20:25` **You**

Henry doesn't count\.\. fyi


**037.** `20:26` **You**

So there will be no Sowing of Oats\.\.


**038.** `20:26` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Yes I‚Äôm aware of Henry‚Äôs positioning in the priority list


**039.** `20:26` **You**

near the top


**040.** `20:26` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Noted


**041.** `20:26` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

lol


**042.** `20:26` **You**

but not above you\.\. let's be clear


**043.** `20:26` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Mmm hmm


**044.** `20:26` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Such a liar


**045.** `20:27` **You**

true story\.\. would pcik you 10/10 vs Henry


**046.** `20:27` **You**

listen I know you would pick Morgan 10/10 vs me\.\. it's ok\.\. I am comfortable in my decision\.


**047.** `20:27` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

I would not\!


**048.** `20:28` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

However, if there were such a thing as a hall pass ü§î


**049.** `20:29` **You**

mmmm\.\. I don't think there is\.  At least not that I have heard of\.\. I could chatgpt it, and see what it thinks about the idea\.


**050.** `20:29` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

There totally is


**051.** `20:30` **You**

yeah no


**052.** `20:31` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

lol


**053.** `20:32` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

You obviously need to look it up


**054.** `20:34` **You**

I read what GPT had to say\.\.


**055.** `20:34` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

If gpt knows, it‚Äôs a thing


**056.** `20:35` **You**

Oh no\.\. it's a thing\.\. the yeah no was actually after I read what GPT said lol


**057.** `20:35` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

lol


**058.** `20:37` **You**

well I was thinking about getting tickets to his concert\.\.\. but hell no now\.\.


**059.** `20:37` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Too $$$$


**060.** `20:38` **You**

**061.** `20:38` **You**

I was looking at seats last night actually\.


**062.** `20:39` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Stop\. Stop\. Stop\.


**063.** `20:39` **You**

Why?


**064.** `20:40` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Because we are going to be smart with our money bc things will be a little dicey for a while


**065.** `20:45` **You**

**066.** `20:45` **You**

was my birthday present to me \- and by extension you\.\.\.\.\.\.


**067.** `20:46` **You**

**068.** `20:46` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

**069.** `20:47` **You**

**070.** `20:47` **You**

**071.** `20:48` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

We were both born on the 11th\. Interesting\. Wonder what that means


**072.** `20:49` **You**

I already noted that\.\. but was not sure there was an implication\.


**073.** `20:50` **You**

I was born at lunch time\.\. does that mean anything? :\)


**074.** `20:50` **You**

>
the other idea i had was bringing maddie too\.\. her birthday is the 15th\.\. still wasn;t sure how I would manage that\.\. but would have worked on it\.

**075.** `20:51` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

That‚Äôs a lovely little connection ‚Äî sharing the same day of the month, even if your birthdays are in different months, can feel meaningful, especially when you‚Äôre emotionally close\. Here‚Äôs a gentle take on what it might suggest or symbolize:
üåó Numerological Vibe ‚Äì The Number 11
In numerology, 11 is considered a ‚Äúmaster number‚Äù, associated with:
- intuition
- spiritual insight
- emotional depth
- a desire for meaningful connection
Two people who both have the 11 as a core part of their birthdate may:
- feel a strong, often inexplicable emotional connection
- mirror each other‚Äôs emotional intensity or internal worlds
- share a quiet understanding or mutual respect for each other‚Äôs complexity
üå∏ Symbolically
Same\-day birthdays \(different months\) can create a feeling of cosmic alignment or kinship\. It‚Äôs one of those things that makes people go, ‚ÄúOh wow, that‚Äôs special\!‚Äù ‚Äî and in relationships, those little sparks of synchronicity can feel like fate gently brushing your shoulders\.
üí´ Astrological Differences
- You‚Äôre an Aries \(April 11\) ‚Äì passionate, bold, instinctive\.
- He‚Äôs a Virgo \(September 11\) ‚Äì thoughtful, precise, grounded\.
So while your styles may differ, the shared ‚Äú11‚Äù could be a thread that reminds you that you‚Äôre emotionally connected even if you approach life from different angles\.

**082.** `20:52` **You**

**083.** `20:52` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Does maddie like Morgan also?


**084.** `20:52` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

The answer is probably: duh of course, who doesn‚Äôt


**085.** `20:52` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

lol


**086.** `20:53` **You**

no


**087.** `20:53` **You**

her friend is into country\.\. I am not sure she is


**088.** `20:54` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Was just reading and got to this: Aries can be too blunt; Virgo too critical\.


**089.** `20:54` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

LOL


**090.** `20:55` **You**

sounds about right


**091.** `20:57` **You**

**092.** `20:58` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Depends\. Roger‚Äôs centre and scotiabank very different


**093.** `20:58` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Scotiabank you are almost good anywhere bc it is smaller


**094.** `20:59` **You**

he is playing rogers


**095.** `20:59` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Rogers \- apparently in the 500s you can‚Äôt even hear sometimes


**096.** `20:59` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

When we were at Jonas bros ppl in 500s couldn‚Äôt hear


**097.** `20:59` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

They were tweeting it


**098.** `20:59` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Yeah\. She‚Äôs worried for sure


**139.** `21:34` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Been listening to Mac who is excited ugh


**140.** `21:35` **You**

yeah\.\. there was a bit of drama upstairs\.\. gracie asked me something about where I was thinking of living this year\.\. and I suggested an area that is near a couple of Maddie's friends, apparently Maddie gets everything\.\. Gracie gets nothing\.\. Jaimie kinda started in on me and I was like nope\.\. nope\.\. I have heard enough about Gracie\.\. if you want to call this something call it logical consequences\.


**141.** `21:35` **You**

anyhow I didn't stick around to discuss


**142.** `21:37` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Oh boy‚Ä¶ yeah there is still a ton of transition to get through\. After renting this place, it has kind of hit me like a ton of bricks how big it will be initially for Marlowe\. Not as self sufficient as the other 2 in getting around etc


**143.** `21:38` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

But once her volleyball starts up I think she will be ok


**144.** `21:38` **You**

yeah it always was going to be a bit more of a challenge for her\.


**145.** `21:38` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

She‚Äôs obsessed with vball and has tons of it planned for summer and fall


**146.** `21:38` **You**

well sure the busier she is the less she has to think about


**147.** `21:38` **You**

I am trying to adopt the same approach\.\.   Maybe I should get back into sports\!\! lo


**148.** `21:38` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

**151.** `21:44` **You**

I need to find something where I can be busy on a regular basis\.


**152.** `21:47` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

I told Marlowe she can have the big room when she is there and she goes: That room looks like the room a YouTuber had when I was younger that I wanted so badly lol


**153.** `21:47` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

So that‚Äôs good I guess


**154.** `21:51` **You**

All weekends suck when we aren‚Äôt together what is special about this one


**172.** `22:02` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

This one is just going to happen very soon bc it is already tues


**173.** `22:02` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

That‚Äôs all


**174.** `22:04` **You**

Oh well yeah it is what it is‚Ä¶ I mean honestly week is not much better tbh\.\. meh doesn‚Äôt matter just grind forward\.


**175.** `22:04` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Do you remember saying one night that you think I‚Äôm going to regret getting together with you?


**176.** `22:04` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Like you said it in a serious way


**177.** `22:04` **You**

Yeah


**178.** `22:05` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

You do remember?


**179.** `22:05` **You**

Yes


**180.** `22:05` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

I thought maybe you wouldn‚Äôt


**181.** `22:05` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

You don‚Äôt still feel like that though


**182.** `22:05` **You**

Nope i remember


**183.** `22:07` **You**

It will depend on me I think\.\. partly why I am trying to get sorted no one needs an anchor you want a partner\.\. so I guess I  concerned about my ability to really kind of become more self
Sufficient etc as I mentioned earlier\.


**184.** `22:08` **You**

I fell like the perfect person for you is someone who when you are apart needs like no maintenance but is there to have an awesome time when the time is available\.


**185.** `22:08` **You**

I just know I am not that lol not even close


**186.** `22:09` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

You do not need to change for me\. I‚Äôve known you for a while now and know you don‚Äôt need to change


**187.** `22:10` **You**

I need to change for me too Mer\.\.
But the regret thing was about more than me if you remember\.


**188.** `22:11` **You**

It was about having the freedom to kind of go out have fun no consequences or ties more like your undergrad years I guess\.  I think we were watching bad moms maybe?


**189.** `22:11` **You**

Or maybe it was night before


**190.** `22:11` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Sow oats kind of thing lol


**191.** `22:12` **You**

Well I guess if you like that saying\.\. but I think the way I framed it is more how I felt


**192.** `22:14` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

And my answer to that still stands


**193.** `22:14` **You**

Yeah I know\.\. all your friends are married so it wouldn‚Äôt work anyways:


**194.** `22:15` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

üòú


**195.** `22:16` **You**

I mean it is understandable\.


**196.** `22:17` **You**

I think you mentioned something about a fork in the road or something maybe I was drunk\.\. I don‚Äôt think you completely discounted it right?


**197.** `22:17` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

I definitely completely discounted it\!


**198.** `22:18` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Even if there was that fork in the road, I wouldn‚Äôt take that road


**199.** `22:18` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

I mean, I have you but even if I didn‚Äôt I have 3 kids and a life


**200.** `22:18` **You**

lol ok mer\.\.  no bad moms action for you\.


**201.** `22:18` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

I‚Äôm not just going to do a complete 180


**202.** `22:19` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Marlowe would literally kill me


**203.** `22:19` **You**

Anyhow who knows what you will regret or you won‚Äôt\.\. we will have to see


**204.** `22:19` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

**205.** `22:19` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

**206.** `22:19` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

**207.** `22:20` **You**

**208.** `22:20` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**
