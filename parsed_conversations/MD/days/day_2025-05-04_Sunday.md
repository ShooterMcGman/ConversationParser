Well then I should leave you to try to sleep\.


**016.** `02:56` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Will you sleep?


**017.** `02:56` **You**

Not likely


**018.** `02:57` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

But you will try


**019.** `02:58` **You**

I mean sure I guess pretty awake tho\.  It‚Äôs fine I slept straight since 1120


**020.** `02:58` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

That‚Äôs not much sleep


**021.** `02:59` **You**

More than I get a lot of times


**022.** `02:59` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Maybe you just need more sleep to feel better


**023.** `03:00` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Maybe lack of sleep is driving you nuts


**024.** `03:01` **You**

Maybe you are really tired and should just go to bed lol sound like it\.  Don‚Äôt worry about me I will do whatever


**025.** `03:01` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Reaction: ‚ù§Ô∏è from Meredith Lamb
Stayed home and dreamed of us\.  Was nice ‚ù§Ô∏è


**029.** `09:54` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Slept in‚Ä¶\. Still not up\. Gummies are good for my sleep apparently\.


**030.** `09:59` **You**

Yeah I am getting up now need to do work


**031.** `10:00` **You**

Another super fun day\!\! Whee


**032.** `10:07` **You**

Demotivated for a number of reasons no matter how successful I am in one place something else falls
Apart
It seems\.\. here there everywhere\. What a mess\.  Changed my Hyksos last night to declutterring my mind and getting rid of negative thoughts but it will take some time to work I think


**033.** `10:13` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

I think it will eventually all come together but there is a lot of fall out you will probably be dealing with for a long time‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt think it means everything is falling apart tho\.


**034.** `10:13` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Just bumps in the road


**035.** `10:14` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Really big pot holes


**036.** `10:20` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

I was thinking about your control comment and I‚Äôm not doing that intentionally by any means\. But I can see what you mean\. It isn‚Äôt you though it is more my life and everything going on and just protecting speed, flow, intensity \(not that I‚Äôve done a good job\)\. This has moved really fast\. Like really‚Ä¶ and we aren‚Äôt even out of our respective situations yet\. My kids don‚Äôt even know\. Gah\. Yet I‚Äôm looking at a rental tonight and will have to make some story to them about where I am\.


**037.** `10:20` **You**

The only thing I have positive movement on is me physically


**038.** `10:20` **You**

lol


**039.** `10:20` **You**

The control thing is about protecting yourself

*üí¨ Reply*

**045.** `10:21` **You**

It isn‚Äôt about wanting to own me


**046.** `10:21` **You**

I think it will break down in time


**047.** `10:22` **You**

As you become more comfortable


**048.** `10:22` **You**

I was just 85% comfortable
With you immediately


**049.** `10:22` **You**

And was willing to put a lot on trust


**050.** `10:22` **You**

Am willing


**051.** `10:22` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

>
I have a lot to protect right now\. My life is a shitstorm\.

*üí¨ Reply*

**052.** `10:22` **You**

I meant yourself


**053.** `10:22` **You**

Not everything


**054.** `10:22` **You**

Just you


**055.** `10:22` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Yeah


**056.** `10:23` **You**

I think you have a harder time to let go to give
Over
To someone else
To trust


**057.** `10:23` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Well you could impulsively change your mind on me tomorrow\. You do that with decisions and ppl


**058.** `10:23` **You**

And rightly so


**059.** `10:23` **You**

No


**060.** `10:23` **You**

I dont


**061.** `10:23` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Yes


**062.** `10:23` **You**

I told you I thought about this thing for years


**063.** `10:23` **You**

Before deciding to pull the trigger


**064.** `10:23` **You**

But when I pull it I am sure


**065.** `10:24` **You**

That is the diff


**066.** `10:24` **You**

And with you I have been nearly 100% transparent and honest which is like\. I thing before the buys I hold back are to protect me and my perception of what you might do if I open up all the way


**067.** `10:25` **You**

So honestly you have nothing to worry about I am saying this and don‚Äôt correct me‚Ä¶ I am never leaving


**068.** `10:25` **You**

Ever


**069.** `10:25` **You**

I don‚Äôt care about the process


**070.** `10:25` **You**

This is not impulsive it is something else
Revelationary


**071.** `10:25` **You**

It I am as certain of this and of using absolutes


**072.** `10:26` **You**

Again barring you don‚Äôt do something terrible which I cannot foresee or believe you would do to me


**073.** `10:26` **You**

There that is all there is


**074.** `10:26` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

And I think I know all that deep down but my head has a very strong protect mode perhaps


**075.** `10:27` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Not sure


**076.** `10:27` **You**

I head and heart


**077.** `10:27` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

I really believe what you say like 90%


**078.** `10:27` **You**

There are no detours here me


**079.** `10:27` **You**

Mer


**080.** `10:27` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

There is a piece of me that is all ‚Äúmm Hmmh‚Äù


**081.** `10:27` **You**

No off ramps


**082.** `10:27` **You**

This is not a game


**083.** `10:27` **You**

And I have never been more serious


**084.** `10:28` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

I will try to believe you with everything that I have because I really hope that is true for both of us


**085.** `10:28` **You**

Again problem is I cannot show you lol


**086.** `10:28` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Yeah


**087.** `10:29` **You**

Please
Don‚Äôt try please just believe doubt is the killer of relationships my doubt of you and Andrew almost
Broke me


**088.** `10:29` **You**

It still bothers me but I can shut it down


**089.** `10:30` **You**

I know there is nothing going on I know you aren‚Äôt going back to him\.\. I say that over and over\.\. and I force doubt to fuck off\.


**090.** `10:31` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

I don‚Äôt sit and live in doubt\. I just for sure have it but I don‚Äôt focus on it tbh and if I could see you, feel you, taste you ‚Ä¶ it would all go away‚Ä¶\.\.


**091.** `10:31` **You**

Yeah and my worry is you cannot last‚Ä¶ despite my concerns I know I can last it will just hurt a lot\. But be worth it in the end


**092.** `10:32` **You**

I still have that concern\.\. cannot help that one \.  Which is why I wanted to get to a scenario where we could have some
Predictable interaction


**093.** `10:32` **You**

And then last night that sounded way the fuck off


**094.** `10:32` **You**

So yeah it was a little fought


**095.** `10:32` **You**

Rough


**096.** `10:32` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

I will figure something out


**097.** `10:33` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

I think I can last


**098.** `10:33` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

It will just impact my behaviour


**099.** `10:33` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

But I will do my best obviously\.


**100.** `10:33` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

All of this is a lot and I still have so much to deal with here


**101.** `10:34` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

So I‚Äôm not too concerned short term


**102.** `10:34` **You**

You don‚Äôt need to compromise yourself
For this


**103.** `10:34` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

More longer time


**104.** `10:34` **You**

I told you I will deal


**105.** `10:34` **You**

**106.** `10:35` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Yeah and getting more and more so


**107.** `10:35` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Not even staying the same


**108.** `10:35` **You**

Look you keep on with your thing\.\. this is what I am worried about for you things will
Get worse and you will be like fuck it not worth it


**109.** `10:36` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

No I will not Scott\.


**110.** `10:36` **You**

So just don‚Äôt let me affect you I will try to keep down the emotions for a while


**111.** `10:37` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Reaction: ‚ù§Ô∏è from Scott Hicks
I can lie here and imagine kissing your neck and I feel better


**112.** `10:37` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

I will be fine


**113.** `10:37` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

**114.** `10:37` **You**

Reaction: üòÇ from Meredith Lamb

*üí¨ Reply*

**116.** `10:38` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

I will find them all\. Don‚Äôt tell me


**117.** `10:39` **You**

It will mean shorter convos I think\.\.  because eventually they come out\. I matter what I do\.\. but I think I can manage that\.

*üí¨ Reply*

**118.** `10:40` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

I like your emotions but not when they are pulling you into a deep dark hole\.


**119.** `10:40` **You**

I also won‚Äôt bug you about trip idea anymore as I think it just puts pressure on you\.


**120.** `10:41` **You**

Reaction: üò¢ from Meredith Lamb

Yeah I know that but deep dark holes seem to be the norm lately\.

**121.** `10:41` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

You haven‚Äôt been bugging me\. Relax\.

*üí¨ Reply*

**122.** `10:41` **You**

I still have no problems telling you how I feel about you and that hasn‚Äôt chenged an inch through all of this only gotten stronger


**123.** `10:42` **You**

>
Well it is that and knowing you cannot do anything about it\.  I get disappointed so best to just forget about it\.\. for now at least\.  I will take some time for me because I need it I will figure out what that looks like

*üí¨ Reply*

**124.** `10:43` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

When Mackenzie and Andrew and Mar Mar are in Edmonton at nationals maybe we can swing something


**125.** `10:43` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Work dinner lol


**126.** `10:44` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

We will see ‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm not opposed to a trip at all but it can‚Äôt be suspicious and I need to get my ass moved out of this house so I may need to take time off to move


**127.** `10:48` **You**

Yep understood I get it\.\. sorry I just had to go upstairs to make my morning drink and take my pills


**128.** `10:49` **You**

Again somehow I need to shit down a bit for a while lower expectations\.\. and I think that will help me cope\.\. if I can do that or not is a good question\.


**129.** `10:50` **You**

But I cannot remain this open and vulnerable all the time and not take body blows every days


**130.** `10:50` **You**

Like it isn‚Äôt what you are doing to me it is life


**131.** `10:51` **You**

Deleted?


**132.** `10:51` **You**

lol


**133.** `10:52` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

I hope it isn‚Äôt me\. I will open up to you about anything you want\. I just may not exactly initiate these big msgs of emotional revelations on the fly while focusing on all this other crap


**134.** `10:52` **You**

I don‚Äôt need you too especially not now


**135.** `10:53` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Finding balancing all of the stuff ‚Ä¶\. Challenging\. And holy, the secrecy piece is about to make me lose it\. I have 2 secrecy pieces : 1\. My kids and then 2\. Us


**136.** `10:54` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

I feel like I‚Äôm navigating this strange world where everyone in my life knows a different version of my reality right now and I have to try to remember what that version is constantly


**137.** `10:54` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

üòú


**138.** `10:54` **You**

Yep I know that feeling \.\. but I was built for that\.


**139.** `10:54` **You**

That is exactly how my brain helps me\.


**140.** `10:55` **You**

When it is not stomping on everything else I don‚Äôt know why it does this to me it is really distressing but it has consistently through my whole life\.


**141.** `10:55` **You**

Might be a childhood thing


**142.** `10:56` **You**

I was never good enough\.\. as much as
I loved
My mum and we were as tight as
You could be, that is how I was raised and it was kind of relentless and brutal


**143.** `10:56` **You**

And I mean that shapes you


**144.** `10:56` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

>
This tracks incredibly‚Ä¶\.

*üí¨ Reply*

**145.** `10:56` **You**

**146.** `10:56` **You**

I would be compared
To
Others to my sister but always in a manner Thant
Made
Me less than


**147.** `10:57` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

I feel it in your anxieties about us


**148.** `10:57` **You**

Because she thought it would motivate me


**149.** `10:57` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

They are all related to not being good enough it seems or either fucking something up


**150.** `10:57` **You**

You are soo important to me it is not even rational


**151.** `10:57` **You**

So yeah my brain went into overdrive, and so did my heart same time


**152.** `10:57` **You**

And my heart had t done shit for a
Long long time


**153.** `10:57` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Our relationship is not built on performance though\. I am not connected to you for that reason\.


**154.** `10:58` **You**

It isn‚Äôt necessarily performance it is connection


**155.** `10:58` **You**

I mean I worry about performance don‚Äôt get me wrong we talked kind of about that the other night


**156.** `10:58` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

I mean performance is all aspects


**157.** `10:58` **You**

**161.** `10:59` **You**

**163.** `10:59` **You**

Selective responses etc


**164.** `10:59` **You**

**165.** `10:59` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

To the beginning of the night


**166.** `11:00` **You**

Of yesterday or the night before


**167.** `11:00` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

**169.** `11:00` **You**

lol


**170.** `11:00` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Yep and I wasn‚Äôt avoiding per se\. I seriously was really stoned\.


**171.** `11:01` **You**

Kk well don‚Äôt worry again I am not needing you to open up about anything right now so we can all relax
And take a breath


**172.** `11:02` **You**

The timeline has changed and expected accessibility has changed so speed has changed


**173.** `11:02` **You**

So I need to change


**174.** `11:02` **You**

Not in a bad way mer


**175.** `11:02` **You**

‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è


**176.** `11:02` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

**177.** `11:02` **You**

It isn‚Äôt just your neck I want\.\.


**178.** `11:03` **You**

Fyi


**179.** `11:03` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Is there something that is like super annoying you that I am not sharing out loud? Or just that weekend because I wouldn‚Äôt let you


**180.** `11:04` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

>
Same‚Ä¶\. ‚ù§Ô∏è

*üí¨ Reply*

**181.** `11:04` **You**

That isn‚Äôt super annoying me\. It was frustrating me because 1\. Fair play lol\.  2\. It has been my experience that that is enjoyable for others and I wanted to please you


**182.** `11:04` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

So here‚Äôs my insecurity


**183.** `11:04` **You**

That is all and then the refusal
Obviously begs questions but wait


**184.** `11:05` **You**

You don‚Äôt have
To


**185.** `11:05` **You**

I told you you don‚Äôt need to do this I can wait fine


**186.** `11:06` **You**

These are pretty tough topics we don‚Äôt need to wade
In now\.\.


**187.** `11:07` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

But it is so clich√© I hate even talking about it\. I have never dated anyone 1\. Post kids and 2\. At this weight\. Like never been in this realm before even weight wise\. So it is all kind of unsettling and new to me\. Andrew was used to it but when we got together even I was very fit\. Anyway it is an odd one for me and definitely an insecurity\. Especially after 3 c sections\. Even when I get fit and work out etc etc etc I have a c section shelf\. I try not to focus on all that crap but it definitely bothers me when like lights are shone on it\.


**188.** `11:08` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

I never complain about it bc it is even annoying hearing it come out of my mouth\. Never complained to Andrew about it until recently\.


**189.** `11:08` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

The whole $200k thing


**190.** `11:08` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

I was like ‚Äúare you fucking kidding me?\!‚Äù I have a c section shelf for life and you care about $200k


**191.** `11:08` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

He didn‚Äôt even know what the fuck it was


**192.** `11:08` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Had to google it


**193.** `11:08` **You**

We are
Generally talking about intimacy here\. I think


**194.** `11:08` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

My last c section was 12 yrs ago\.


**195.** `11:08` **You**

Not specifics


**196.** `11:09` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

>
This was more related to last weekend and my ‚Äúcontrol‚Äù

*üí¨ Reply*

**197.** `11:09` **You**

Ok I mean if it bothers you that much I paid 15 k for Jaimie to have a surgery that she wanted that I gave zero fucks about


**198.** `11:09` **You**

But she did it for herself


**199.** `11:10` **You**

Like I think you are beautiful


**200.** `11:10` **You**

Every inch


**201.** `11:10` **You**

Nothing to be self conscious about


**202.** `11:10` **You**

At all


**203.** `11:10` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

I wanted to have that surgery also\. Andrew got mad at me when I suggested it\. üôÑ


**204.** `11:10` **You**

It is your body mer


**205.** `11:10` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

That‚Äôs not the way he worked‚Ä¶\. Entirely\.  üôÑ


**206.** `11:11` **You**

If you are ever curious and want to know I will tell you\.


**207.** `11:11` **You**

But it IS your body not his not
Mine\.


**208.** `11:12` **You**

I just want to make you happy in every way that I can\.\.  but if it makes you uncomfortable
Then I don‚Äôt want to do it\.


**209.** `11:12` **You**

Because
It will achieve the opposite and I would hate to find out you did something you didn‚Äôt want to to make me happy


**210.** `11:12` **You**

Like it would really bother me


**211.** `11:13` **You**

But j 100% had that surgery actually it was more like 5000 she also had a breast reduction which she very
Much regrets now\.


**212.** `11:13` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

I‚Äôm just in a major transition period\. So I‚Äôm not super concerned\. Trying to get back to me weight of like 1\-2 years ago and get back to working out \.\. all while going through this separation crap and kids\.


**213.** `11:13` **You**

I think it was 5 for stomach and 10‚Äôfor all else


**214.** `11:14` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

>
Oh I was talking about breast reduction what surgery are you talking about?

*üí¨ Reply*

**215.** `11:14` **You**

Yeah I know\.\. part
Of why I want us to get together finally we can support each other and grow together as we do it


**216.** `11:14` **You**

Well you said something about shelf


**217.** `11:14` **You**

Which is what Jaimie had removed


**218.** `11:14` **You**

Maybe not same thing


**219.** `11:14` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Did she have c sections


**220.** `11:15` **You**

She did not but she had a shelf
Or whatever she called it


**221.** `11:15` **You**

There is a word


**222.** `11:15` **You**

And it wouldn‚Äôt go away


**223.** `11:15` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Ah


**224.** `11:15` **You**

No matter how much she lost


**225.** `11:15` **You**

You feel you need a breast reduction?


**226.** `11:15` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Mine is c section related


**227.** `11:15` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

C section shelf can‚Äôt be fixed to my knowledge\. It goes so deep\. The incision


**228.** `11:16` **You**

I mean I have nothing but positive things to say in that department mind you but wiuld support whatever you want lol


**229.** `11:16` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Like it is actually numb all around the incision and you can feel how deep it goes\. I cant see them removing that


**230.** `11:16` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

I mean of course but he freaked out in my ass\.

**231.** `11:16` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

\*on


**232.** `11:17` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

We have a major argument


**233.** `11:17` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

\*had omg autocorrect


**234.** `11:17` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Major argument \(no yelling tho lol\)


**235.** `11:17` **You**

So I will suggest


**236.** `11:17` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

So I just didn‚Äôt do it


**237.** `11:17` **You**

The following


**238.** `11:17` **You**

You go see a plastic surgeon


**239.** `11:18` **You**

Because j did not


**240.** `11:18` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

When I lose weight it becomes less of an issue for me


**241.** `11:18` **You**

And she has no feeling there anymore


**242.** `11:18` **You**

And it never came back


**243.** `11:18` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Yes I read about complications like that


**244.** `11:18` **You**

And she is fucking miserable about that


**245.** `11:18` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

My lower abdomen is like that from c section\. Definitely weird feeling


**246.** `11:19` **You**

Gemini says for the shelf thing it is very similar to j and there are 2\-3 surgical options coupled with non surgical


**247.** `11:19` **You**

Some of which would be covered by benefits


**248.** `11:19` **You**

Do you want me to paste it


**249.** `11:19` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

And I can just lose weight and work out\. It isn‚Äôt as much of an issue if I‚Äôm doing that


**250.** `11:19` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

No I‚Äôm going to start working out again


**251.** `11:19` **You**

For sure same things for upper body


**252.** `11:19` **You**

Push\-ups


**253.** `11:20` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

That‚Äôs actually my favourite exercise


**254.** `11:20` **You**

It has an effect so I am told


**255.** `11:20` **You**

Yeah I like push\-ups


**256.** `11:21` **You**

Not sure what I am at in a one time trial but it would be about 50 okus I think\.\. I have done\. Fair bit of work on upper body


**257.** `11:21` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

I used to do 100 every workout


**258.** `11:21` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Built up to that tho


**259.** `11:21` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Over time


**260.** `11:22` **You**

Well I want you to know in the future if
You ever wanted to consider anything g I would be 100% supportive but know I love as
Much as I do just as you are right this second


**261.** `11:22` **You**

That is a lot of push\-ups\.\. lol


**262.** `11:22` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Everyone used to make fun of me


**263.** `11:22` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

It is really only 4 sets of 25


**264.** `11:22` **You**

Why\.\. it is awesome


**265.** `11:23` **You**

If
You are doing 4 sets of straight 25
Push\-ups that is boss\.


**266.** `11:23` **You**

I will resist the urge to lift tonight and just go back in to walk and shit\.


**267.** `11:23` **You**

When is Andrew getting back\.\. tonight sometime I guess


**268.** `11:24` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Reaction: ‚ù§Ô∏è from Scott Hicks
One of my goals to get back\. If I can get back to regular workouts I don‚Äôt need any surgeries

*üìé 1 attachment(s)*

**269.** `11:24` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

He gets back tomorrow morning


**270.** `11:25` **You**

Yeah I think we will get along fine\.\. I think you just need the space and the comfort to be intense I don‚Äôt think we are that far
Off
From each other I think you will be surprised


**271.** `11:25` **You**

I think when you love
Someone that deep a lot of things change


**272.** `11:26` **You**

I am about 4% from abs again I think end of this week you def had abs srsly


**273.** `11:26` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

*üí¨ Reply*

**274.** `11:26` **You**

I am both internally with myself


**275.** `11:27` **You**

And then I let it out in the form of emotions


**276.** `11:27` **You**

Which again and I apologize has not happened like this before


**277.** `11:28` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

You do not have to apologize to me\. I‚Äôm also experiencing something on a level that I have not before and I guess I just process it differently‚Ä¶


**278.** `11:28` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

But I am processing it\.


**279.** `11:31` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

And I‚Äôm dealing with so many other factors punching me in the head\. Example‚Ä¶ Andrew making such a big deal about his fucking $200k\. This shit bugs me and I have to process it too at the same time as all of us/this\. It is just a lot


**280.** `11:33` **You**

Yeah I know


**281.** `11:34` **You**

I am trying not to think about it


**282.** `11:35` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Plus my mom might be legit like dying or something\.  There‚Äôs that too‚Ä¶\.  And Andrew keeps saying shit about my family in this whole separation\. He is basically like nails on a chalkboard\.


**283.** `11:36` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

She‚Äôs having a colonoscopy and endoscopy this Wednesday


**284.** `11:36` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

**302.** `11:38` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Until a couple of virgos I know


**317.** `11:43` **You**

Like i said I will leave it with you I always wanted to meet her but when you said that I felt a sense of urgency


**318.** `11:43` **You**

I don‚Äôt do birthdays


**319.** `11:43` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

You and my dad are both virgos


**320.** `11:44` **You**

I do them for other people


**321.** `11:44` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Oh you are doing your birthday this year


**322.** `11:44` **You**

I will let other people do shit because it made them happy how it always was


**323.** `11:44` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

I mean same


**324.** `11:44` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

But you and I will do it properly


**325.** `11:44` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Not about that


**326.** `11:45` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Just a day to properly thank the universe for all things Scott


**327.** `11:46` **You**

lol that is a long way off mer\.\. not focusing that far out yet\.


**328.** `11:46` **You**

So next week is her bday right\.


**329.** `11:46` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

**330.** `11:46` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

We are doing it next week tho


**331.** `11:46` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Andrew was mad


**332.** `11:47` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

He‚Äôs like ‚ÄúI guess I will go to my moms ALONE on Mother‚Äôs Day‚Äù


**333.** `11:47` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

I looked at him and was like ‚Äúyou know I‚Äôm a fucking mother too right?‚Äù


**334.** `11:47` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Jesus Christ


**335.** `11:47` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

I can‚Äôt even with him anymore


**336.** `11:47` **You**

Eesh


**337.** `11:48` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Little concerned about sharing the cottage\. Another stressor / thing to process now


**338.** `11:48` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

But I think I‚Äôm going to do it anyway


**339.** `11:48` **You**

Yeah I know\.\. you will for
Your kids thigh


**340.** `11:48` **You**

Though I already knew that


**341.** `11:48` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

It is just going to require conversations either him


**342.** `11:48` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Ughhhhh


**343.** `11:48` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

\*with him


**344.** `11:49` **You**

I think part of me is concerned that until we actually can get to a point where everyone knows and then everyone is comfortable and then Andrew doesn‚Äôt freak if I am around kids\.\. we are a long ways off from spending time together\.\. like a long long something I thought about last night


**345.** `11:49` **You**

You guys will have busy weekends all summer right\.\. like it is what it is‚Ä¶ just thinking through


**346.** `11:50` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

My therapist would say Andrew has no right to any of my decisions\.


**347.** `11:50` **You**

He does re his children


**348.** `11:50` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Don‚Äôt want them to hate me or give Andrew cause\.\.

I just need to get in a rental first\.


**364.** `11:54` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Honestly if I have to move and move jobs at the same time, my getting wasted weekends will increase\.


**365.** `11:54` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Too much\.


**366.** `11:54` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Below is a structured, step\-by\-step ‚Äúisochrone‚Äù \(drive\-time\) model for identifying increasingly distant meeting spots from 500 Consumers Drive, Toronto, with a focus on quiet, private, and naturally romantic settings\. We‚Äôll sketch out the methodology first, then populate three concentric ‚Äúrings‚Äù \(5\-, 10\-, and 15\-minute drive times\) while biasing away from westward options\.
‚∏ª
1\. Methodology: Building Your Drive\-Time Isochrones
1\.	Pick your drive\-time thresholds\.
- Ring 1: ~5 minutes
- Ring 2: ~10 minutes
- Ring 3: ~15 minutes
2\.	Use an isochrone tool \(e\.g\., Google Maps Platform, Mapbox Isochrone API\) centered at 500 Consumers Dr to generate these polygons\.
- Filter out western arcs if you want to minimize west\-ward travel\.
- Export the geojson for each ring\.
3\.	Overlay parks/natural areas\.
- Import the isochrone polygons into a GIS or even Google My Maps\.
- Layer on Toronto parks, ravines, gardens data\.
4\.	Score candidate spots by:
- Privacy: smaller parks or off\-path trails
- Romance factor: gardens, water features, sunrise views
- Morning access: open area by ~6 AM
5\.	Select top 3‚Äì5 per ring and test drive\-time in real traffic \(especially on weekday mornings\)\.
‚∏ª
2\. Candidate Locations by Ring
Ring	Drive\-Time ‚â§ ‚Ä¶	Direction Bias	Examples \(quiet ¬∑ romantic\)
1	5 minutes	North / East	\- Crothers Woods \(small ravine trails\)
\- Taylor Creek Park East \(tree\-lined path\)
\- Sunnybrook Park \(western edge\) \(hidden meadows\)
2	10 minutes	North / East	\- Edwards Gardens \(formal gardens & benches\)
\- Toronto Botanical Garden \(private alcoves\)
South	\- Ashbridges Bay Park \(harbor sunrise views\)\*
3	15 minutes	North / South	\- Ravine in David Balfour Park \(wooded shelter\)
East	\- Tommy Thompson Park \(tip peninsula, water vistas\)
Northeast	\- Bluffs lookout near Glen Rouge \(expansive horizon\)
\*Ashbridges Bay can be breezy and semi\-public; go weekday and early\.
‚∏ª
3\. Cascading Impacts & Trade\-Offs
1\.	Closer rings \(5 min\)
- Pros: ultra\-short commute, minimal morning delay\.
- Cons: fewer truly private pockets; small ravines can get dog\-walkers\.
2\.	Mid\-range \(10 min\)
- Pros: formal gardens with benches, more ‚Äúdesigned‚Äù privacy\.
- Cons: may require parking; sometimes ticketing starts early\.
3\.	Outer ring \(15 min\)
- Pros: dramatic viewpoints \(harbor, bluffs\), lots of greenery\.
- Cons: pushes into heavier traffic corridors; risk arriving late\.
‚∏ª
4\. Next Steps & Checkpoint
1\.	Run the actual isochrone in your favorite mapping API, export the rings\.
2\.	Visit 1‚Äì2 top picks from each ring on a weekend morning to confirm vibe\.
3\.	Decide on your sweet spot \(e\.g\. 10\-minute ring at Edwards Gardens bench \#7\)\.
4\.	Establish a recurring ‚Äúsunrise date‚Äù reminder \(I can help schedule that, if you‚Äôd like\)\.
‚∏ª
Quick question to keep us aligned:
Do you want me to draft the Google Maps\-based workflow \(with sample API calls\), or would you prefer I skip straight to refining the shortlist of specific bench/patio coordinates?


**541.** `19:29` **You**

**608.** `21:24` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

I wasn‚Äôt sure how to respond to either of those msgs lol


**609.** `21:27` **You**

Well the first one is obvious the second is just loving post shaves\. Feel younger


**610.** `21:28` **You**

But it doesn‚Äôt require a response


**611.** `21:28` **You**

It is an observation and one I think is common


**612.** `21:36` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

When you‚Äôre feeling even beyond overwhelmed, it can move into what psychologists sometimes call:
- Emotional flooding ‚Äì when your nervous system is overloaded and you feel unable to process or respond clearly\. It can come with tears, numbness, irritability, or even a shutdown feeling\.
- Dysregulation ‚Äì when your emotions are so heightened that your mind and body can‚Äôt stay balanced\. It‚Äôs like your inner system is short\-circuiting\.
- Overcapacity ‚Äì not a clinical term, but a deeply real one\. It means your mental, emotional, and physical bandwidth has been maxed out, and even small things feel enormous\.
- Disintegration ‚Äì the opposite of feeling integrated or whole\. It‚Äôs when your usual coping tools and sense of self feel like they‚Äôre coming apart, even if temporarily\.
- Collapse ‚Äì when the system doesn‚Äôt fight or flee anymore‚Äîit just drops\. You may feel flat, hopeless, or disconnected\.
These states are often signs that your body and heart are begging for gentleness, not more pressure to ‚Äúdeal with it\.‚Äù
