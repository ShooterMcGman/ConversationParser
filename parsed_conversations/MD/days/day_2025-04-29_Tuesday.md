I had to take over Gracie‚Äôs appointment because she wouldn‚Äôt go‚Ä¶\. Again‚Ä¶ I had to go see him anyways\.\. just some stuff,
Nothing for you to worry about\.


**057.** `17:13` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

**058.** `17:14` **You**

Well we are
Old there is always something ‚Äúwrong‚Äù


**059.** `17:15` **You**

Anyways it doesn‚Äôt help not having a paternal history‚Ä¶ Fack\.


**060.** `17:20` **You**

Not much more I can do anyways\.\.
BP related, trying to get off that\.\. he is hesitant\.\. something about some potential tests\.\. I have to track a bunch of stuf for the next little while\.


**061.** `17:42` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

**062.** `17:45` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

**067.** `18:08` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

**068.** `18:08` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

**069.** `18:26` **You**

Nah I got shot
To take care
If I am not happy with where I am at\.\. there stuff that isn‚Äôt right and it needs to be addressed\.  Like I said don‚Äôt worry about it, just something I will need to deal with\.


**070.** `18:31` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

My mom has always had high bp\.
Our power was out for hours and just came back on phewwww going to do some work now


**071.** `19:19` **You**

Kkk have fun whiplash all over the place here we‚Äôre staying we‚Äôre going can we work something out where I buy you out of the house but can still afford to stay\.\. to which I said no\.\. I would need to give a lot more and that would be well beyond reasonable Gracie still refuses to go what a fucking shit show\.


**072.** `19:26` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Total shit show\. My crew is on the way home and not looking forward to arrival\. Ugh\.


**073.** `19:56` **You**

What are you predicting I thought you and Andrew had reached an accommodation or is there whiplash there too?


**074.** `19:56` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Sorry accident


**075.** `19:56` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

I don‚Äôt think I can predict at this point\.


**076.** `19:57` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

I‚Äôd just like to go to a mediator now so hoping he will be receptive to that\.


**077.** `19:57` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

**078.** `19:57` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

**079.** `19:57` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

It‚Äôs been lovely\.


**080.** `20:24` **You**

Reaction: ‚ù§Ô∏è from Meredith Lamb
If things get bad mer think about the slow dance think about the fact that someone loves you so much you are home to them\. Think about all of that and then think somewhere down the road, we get to have that\.  That is what I am holding onto here\.


**081.** `20:28` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Today is definitely a bit of an adjustment\. Quite the rollercoaster we are on‚Ä¶


**082.** `20:32` **You**

Yeah I know but at least we are on it together\.


**083.** `20:34` **You**

I am heading to the gym can you please
Let me know you are ok tonight\.\. I worry that all the stuff he would be thinking about this weekend will hit you like a truck\.


**084.** `20:35` **You**

Gracie had a meltdown here\.\. she wants to stay I basically said I am selling the house one way or the other\.
Which is really what she is trying to control she cannot deal with any change\.  She thinks she is ready for university
But she is not\.\. this will be tough but I still hope she can make it back to Moncton I will have to fly up regularly I suspect but she will do better there\.


**085.** `20:37` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

That sounds very difficult for her for sure\. Not easy\.
I can msg later but I might go to bed early and then I don‚Äôt have to talk to him\. lol


**086.** `20:38` **You**

Ok :\( well please let
Me know you are ok I am really worried\. I will leave you be, going to get my shit and go in and try to work off everything I am feeling\.


**087.** `20:42` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

I will be good\. The missing you will be worse than anything here\.
