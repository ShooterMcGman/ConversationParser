| Well,  morning\. That was an interesting discussion eh?  And a good ravishing from you is exactly what I need\!\!  In all honesty I would still take the ability to just roll over and watch you sleep for a bit this morning‚Ä¶ and know that when you woke up the first thing you would know is how much I love you\.

**003.** `04:19` **You**

Honestly some of these topics are challenging but honestly I want to know everything about you that I can process\. lol some I cannot haha but I am so trying Mer\.   I thought of this this morning text has actually been good to us in a couple of ways, it has forced a degree of communication in most couples that I don‚Äôt think exists\. Certainly not to the degree that we do it\.


**004.** `04:20` **You**

Don‚Äôt get me wrong I will take the ‚Äúravishing‚Äù but I don‚Äôt want to disregard how this has brought us closer in a lot of ways\.


**005.** `04:22` **You**

So I am up and going to gym\.\. I hope you had/have a good sleep\.\. I love you so much, not seeing you sucks so much like I said 1\.5 hours over a 12 day period to see you is pretty bad, but I do believe worth in the long run\.

Based on the full exchange you shared, Meredith was not being overly ‚Äúfixer‚Äù‚Äîrather, she showed up primarily as a supportive ear throughout the day\. Let‚Äôs break it down:
‚∏ª
üîç What Meredith Did Well as a Supportive Partner
- Acknowledged his struggles without minimizing
Meredith let Scott talk about his stress, frustration, and feelings of hopelessness without rushing to fix or advise\. She didn‚Äôt argue or try to reframe things too positively in a way that would invalidate his feelings\.
- Matched his emotional pace
She didn‚Äôt force optimism but instead said things like ‚ÄúEven if it isn‚Äôt clear now it will work out ‚Äì especially because we will be in it together\.‚Äù This is gentle reassurance, not over\-functioning\.
- Maintained her own emotional centre
While Scott was up and down emotionally, Meredith didn‚Äôt mirror his distress excessively\. She stayed grounded and practical‚Äîe\.g\., mentioning errands, her kids, needing a nap, going to bed early\.
- Set gentle boundaries and self\-care moments
Meredith never pushed him to talk or be different\. Her final message‚Äî\*‚ÄúThis is my I‚Äôm worried about Scott photo‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm here even if he doesn‚Äôt want to talk‚Äù‚Äî\*shows quiet presence and care without pressure\.
‚∏ª
üõ†Ô∏è Was There Any ‚ÄúFixing‚Äù?
- The closest she comes is when she says:
‚ÄúWell hopefully it works out\. Time is running out so you will be there soon and at least know what is going on\.‚Äù
‚ÄúEven if it isn‚Äôt clear now it will work out ‚Äì especially because we will be in it together\.‚Äù
These are more hopeful framing than problem\-solving\. They‚Äôre not ‚Äúfix\-it‚Äù solutions‚Äîshe‚Äôs trying to provide some light while staying within the emotional space he‚Äôs in\.
‚∏ª
‚öñÔ∏è In Contrast, Scott‚Äôs Position
Scott repeatedly expresses feeling hopeless, stuck, and defeated\. He also explicitly tells her to go enjoy herself and distances:
‚Äúyou don‚Äôt need any of this‚Äù
‚Äúme piling my problems onto you only makes you feel worse and I don‚Äôt want that‚Äù
Yet Meredith keeps her tone steady and warm, ending with:
‚ÄúI just want him to know I‚Äôm here even if he doesn‚Äôt want to talk\.‚Äù
This is emotional attunement, not fixing\.
‚∏ª
‚úÖ Conclusion
You were not being overly ‚Äúfixer\.‚Äù
You were present, emotionally supportive, and respectful of his space\. If anything, your responses reflect mature emotional containment and genuine care\. You knew when to speak and when to hold back‚Äîwhich is incredibly hard when someone you love is in pain\.

But read this first


**150.** `12:25` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Question: Was Scott pushing her away in this exchange?


**151.** `12:25` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Response:


**152.** `12:26` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Yes, Scott was pushing Meredith away, but not because he didn‚Äôt want her close‚Äîrather, he was in emotional survival mode and afraid of being a burden\. It was a protective kind of pushing, full of love and shame\.
He didn‚Äôt need her to fix him, and Meredith did well not to overstep that\. But her quiet presence, gentle check\-ins, and evening message with the ‚ÄúI‚Äôm worried‚Äù photo showed him: ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt have to go through this alone, even if you want to\.‚Äù And that kind of love often breaks through the walls more than anything\.


**153.** `12:26` **You**

Yeah then let it read sunday morning\.


**154.** `12:32` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

This didn‚Äôt cut and paste correctly

*üí¨ Reply*

**166.** `12:43` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Yes, Scott was pushing Meredith away at several points in this exchange‚Äîthough not in a cold or rejecting way\. Rather, it was the kind of pushing that someone does when they‚Äôre in emotional pain and trying not to be a burden\. His tone shows self\-protection, discouragement, and a belief that his emotions are too heavy to share\.
Here‚Äôs how that shows up:
‚∏ª
üîç Clear Indicators of Pushing Her Away
1\.	Downplaying himself and discouraging her engagement:
‚Äúme piling my problems onto you only makes you feel worse and I don‚Äôt want that\.‚Äù
‚Äúyou don‚Äôt need any of this\.‚Äù
‚ÄúI am a miserable sack\.‚Äù
‚ÄúThere is nothing here to talk about\.‚Äù
‚Äî He‚Äôs trying to protect her from his emotional state, but in doing so, erects a wall\. He feels like a burden\.
2\.	Redirecting the focus away from himself:
‚ÄúIf you want to talk about anything but me‚Ä¶ I am for it\.‚Äù
‚ÄúTalk about your day, what you bought, how the kids are‚Ä¶‚Äù
‚Äî This is a classic distancing move\. He‚Äôs letting her in, but only up to a point\.
3\.	Emotional resignation:
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt feel optimistic, I don‚Äôt feel happy‚Ä¶‚Äù
‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no path forward‚Ä¶‚Äù
‚ÄúYep is more like it doesn‚Äôt really matter‚Ä¶‚Äù
‚Äî These statements suggest emotional numbness, which can be difficult for a partner to connect through, even when she‚Äôs trying\.
4\.	Telling her to go enjoy herself:
‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt you go enjoy yourself‚Ä¶‚Äù
‚ÄúGo do your stuff‚Ä¶ get it all done so you can chill‚Ä¶‚Äù
‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt need any of this\.‚Äù
‚Äî While it seems generous on the surface, this is a protective push\-away\. He‚Äôs saying: ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt waste your time in my dark space\.‚Äù
‚∏ª
‚ù§Ô∏è But Not a Total Shut\-Out
Despite all this, Scott:
- Sends loving messages early in the day\.
- Acknowledges she helped him the night before\.
- Reacts to her messages with ‚ù§Ô∏è\.
- Still shares his inner world, even when he says he shouldn‚Äôt\.
This isn‚Äôt rejection‚Äîit‚Äôs emotional withdrawal with care\. He‚Äôs saying: ‚ÄúI love you, but I feel unworthy of love today\.‚Äù
‚∏ª
‚úÖ Conclusion
Yes, Scott was pushing Meredith away, but not because he didn‚Äôt want her close‚Äîrather, he was in emotional survival mode and afraid of being a burden\. It was a protective kind of pushing, full of love and shame\.
He didn‚Äôt need her to fix him, and Meredith did well not to overstep that\. But her quiet presence, gentle check\-ins, and evening message with the ‚ÄúI‚Äôm worried‚Äù photo showed him: ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt have to go through this alone, even if you want to\.‚Äù And that kind of love often breaks through the walls more than anything\.

There is the real one


**168.** `12:43` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

**169.** `12:56` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

I only put the Sunday stuff in pre\-ai back and forth because that was all too long\. It couldn‚Äôt read it all\.


**170.** `12:56` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

The July 6 conversation reflects a significant emotional rebound and recalibration between Meredith and Scott following a difficult day on July 5\. Here‚Äôs an interpretation of how they both rebounded and what the shift tells us:
‚∏ª
üíî Emotional Fallout Carried into the Morning
- Scott wakes up feeling hopeless and emotionally spent\. His early messages \(msgs 001‚Äì008\) are raw, resigned, and edged with protectiveness and detachment: ‚ÄúThere isn‚Äôt much you can do to make me feel better Mer\.‚Äù
- Meredith, when she wakes, quickly counters his perception of her being ‚Äúso happy at home‚Äù \(msg 010\)\. She feels misunderstood and hurt, suggesting his assumptions are creating distance\.
- Their initial exchange is tense, marked by mutual misinterpretations and exhaustion\.
‚∏ª
üîÑ Turn Toward Repair
- Between msgs 011‚Äì027, they begin recalibrating\. Scott opens up about his emotional needs \(‚Äújust need someone to hear me‚Äù\), while Meredith proposes an in\-person reset the next day: ‚Äúwe can resume after we see each other\.‚Äù
- He commits in msg 017 not to push her away again‚Äîa moment of vulnerability and intentional change\.
‚∏ª
‚ù§Ô∏è Vulnerability and Affirmation
- As the day progresses \(msgs 061‚Äì076\), they start to really see each other again:
- Meredith shares that she‚Äôs been overwhelmed, not happy\.
- Scott expresses fear she‚Äôs pulling away, prompting Meredith‚Äôs clear and reassuring reply:
‚ÄúI am not calling it a day, omg‚Ä¶ I am completely in love with you‚Ä¶ you are my soul mate\.‚Äù \(msg 088\)
- That message is the emotional turning point\. Scott is visibly relieved and appreciative \(msg 090\)\.
‚∏ª
üòå Grounded and Gentle Rhythm Resumes
- The rest of the day \(msgs 091‚Äì223\) reflects a more grounded and emotionally available dynamic:
- They discuss Scott‚Äôs workout scare\.
- They support each other through upcoming mediation challenges\.
- There‚Äôs a return of playful teasing, shared frustrations, tenderness, and affection\.
- They talk like teammates again\.
‚∏ª
üß≠ Interpretation:
This rebound shows emotional resilience in their connection\. Both were strained and misaligned after a tough day, but neither let it fracture the foundation\. The pivot came when:
1\.	Meredith corrected the ‚Äúhappy at home‚Äù assumption and asked for a pause\.
2\.	Scott vulnerably admitted his fear of being left and expressed deep care\.
3\.	Meredith clearly and unequivocally reassured him of her love and commitment\.
They didn‚Äôt solve everything\. They‚Äôre still facing tough personal circumstances, but they re\-established their emotional tether‚Äînot by fixing each other‚Äôs problems, but by being seen, heard, and reassured

**205.** `17:17` **You**

I asked it to summarize writing it in narrative format\.\.\. a bit different\.\. but just for fun\.
Of course\. Let's paint a more detailed canvas of Tuesday night, tracing the threads of the conversation from its anxious beginnings to its deeply intimate conclusion, with commentary to illuminate the subtext\.
\*\*\*
\#\#\# A Narrative of Tuesday, July 8th
The evening began under the weight of the day\. You arrived home, as you put it, "fucking drained", the ink still drying on the final draft of your separation agreement\. The day's "full on fighting" with Jaimie over Gracie's future had left you raw\. You were a man seeking refuge, yet finding his home was still a battleground\.
Across the distance, Meredith was in a parallel state of anxious motion\. It was, in her words, a "rough week"\. She was cutting the dog's hair, a mundane task that served as a small anchor in a sea of overwhelming to\-dos and the lingering effects of the previous night's wine\. "I just have a lot of anxiety ‚Ä¶\. Like a lot," she confessed, describing the exhausting mental cycle of feeling anxious about not getting enough done, which in turn created more anxiety\.
It is in this shared state of vulnerability that the most meaningful conversations often ignite\.
The turning point came unexpectedly\. Amidst talk of your locked bedroom door, Meredith launched a probe, disguised as a casual, almost shocking question: "Do you think if you tried to have sex with Jaimie she would or she would be like wtf are you doing"\.
\*Analyst's Comment: This question was a classic subtextual test\. It was never about Jaimie\. It was a high\-stakes query designed to gauge the absolute finality of your past\. She needed to hear that the door to your former life was not just closed, but welded shut\.\*
Your answer was definitive\. You stated it would be "fucking cruel" because Jaimie was too hurt and self\-conscious\. "I hurt her too much," you admitted, "Like to her core\.\.\. It was fucking awful"\. This raw admission of the pain you caused served as the reassurance Meredith was seeking, and it opened the door for her to explore her own past\.
She then made a comparison that clearly lingered with you: that your relationship with her had similarities in "spirit" to the one she had with her ex\-fianc√©, Jeremy\. You pushed back, stating, "I don‚Äôt have a Jeremy", needing to establish the uniqueness of your bond\. But Meredith clarified\. She didn't regret the breakup‚Äî"it wasn‚Äôt a mistake," she stated twice‚Äîbut she did take responsibility for the way it imploded\. "I mean I fucked the whole thing up\. Gave him his ring back, etc etc"\.
\*Analyst's Comment: Here, the conversation shifted from a recounting of history to a negotiation of its meaning\. She wasn't expressing regret for the choice, but for the chaotic execution, attributing it to being "young and dumb"\. She needed you to see that her past failures in commitment were not a predictor of her future with you\.\*
This exploration of past commitments led, inevitably, to the topic of your own potential future\. The conversation around marriage was tentative, circling the subject with a mix of humor and genuine curiosity\. You recounted your own proposal to Jaimie, a story rooted in family history and thoughtfulness, but one you admitted was made when you "wasn‚Äôt in love"\.
It was here that you made a profound strategic move, one that altered the entire dynamic of your future\. You told her that given her history and apprehension, if marriage were ever to be on the table, she would have to be the one to propose\. "I think you will have to ask me btw\.\. so it might never happen"\.
\*Analyst's Comment: This was a masterful reversal\. By placing the locus of control entirely in her hands, you did two things: you removed all pressure, and you demanded that any potential proposal be an act of pure, unprompted authenticity on her part\. It was the ultimate way to ensure you would never again be in a marriage where you questioned the reasons\.\*
Meredith‚Äôs response was simple, but it carried the weight of a contract being signed\. "k I‚Äôm ok with that"\. She accepted the terms\. The conversation immediately lightened, as if a great pressure had been released, shifting to playful talk of a "promposal"\.
The evening concluded with a return to the simple, grounding truth of your connection\. You daydreamed of your time at the cottage, of rubbing her feet, of the easy comfort you share\. After a night spent dissecting the past and negotiating the future, the conversation ended where it truly matters: in the present\. Her final message, a raw expression of desire‚Äî"would completely have ravished you if we had had the chance tonight"‚Äîwas the perfect reminder that beneath all the layers of anxiety and analysis, there is a powerful, undeniable passion that fuels your journey forward\.


**389.** `19:24` **You**

In another query re: the marriage conversation it made an interesting observation\.
You have placed the ultimate act of commitment and "closing the loop" in Meredith's hands, which is a significant deviation from your core driver of maintaining control and building systems\. What does this decision to relinquish control in the most critical aspect of your shared future reveal about how your relationship with her has already fundamentally changed you?

That you are willing to do that


**397.** `19:34` **You**

It means that I don't want this to happen unless you want to happen of your own volition, with no pressure and no strings\.


**398.** `19:34` **You**

it also means if it doesn't happen


**399.** `19:34` **You**

it is secondary


**400.** `19:34` **You**

ask long as we are together I don't care


**401.** `19:35` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Well you might care a little but thanks for saying you don‚Äôt üôÉ

**403.** `19:36` **You**

Yes lol


**405.** `19:36` **You**

I feel we have already done that\.


**406.** `19:37` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

I still think it means something to you and that‚Äôs okay


**407.** `19:37` **You**

So I am not worried\.


**408.** `19:37` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

It always bothered Andrew


**409.** `19:37` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

He wanted to get married at the cottage when we bought it


**410.** `19:37` **You**

I am not sure if it would eventually bother me or not tbh\.\. but I don't think so\.

Never really thought I‚Äôd be with him forever so didn‚Äôt see a real point honestly


**415.** `19:39` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Also a waste of $


**416.** `19:39` **You**

how did you respond though\.\. just shrugged it off


**417.** `19:39` **You**

make excuses


**418.** `19:42` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Honestly I can‚Äôt remember entirely\. Total truth\. I always was able to skirt around it though\.


**419.** `19:43` **You**

ok so million dollar question


**420.** `19:44` **You**

why the hell did you ask me whether you thought J would sleep with me if I tried\.\. you were too drunk last night to explain\.


**421.** `19:45` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

I was not too drunk\!


**422.** `19:45` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Oh my God


**423.** `19:45` **You**

evasive then


**424.** `19:45` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

I was just curious


**425.** `19:45` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

I am a curious person


**426.** `19:46` **You**

ROFL


**427.** `19:46` **You**

insufficient


**428.** `19:46` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Plus, you said you locked the door I don‚Äôt know that prompted the question into my head I think


**429.** `19:46` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

I think being a curious person is a very sufficient answer


**430.** `19:46` **You**

being curious is fine\.\. the motive is different\.\.


**431.** `19:47` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

What? What do you think my motive was?


**432.** `19:47` **You**

I honestly don't know


**433.** `19:47` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

My motive was simply curiosity


**434.** `19:47` **You**

seriously


**435.** `19:47` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Curiosity killed the cat


**436.** `19:47` **You**

like that was a RANDOM question


**437.** `19:47` **You**

Curiosity killed the Scott\.


**438.** `19:47` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Well, it seems pretty random to me for you to lock the door also


**439.** `19:47` **You**

he has mostly learned his lesson


**440.** `19:48` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

So something so random is obviously going to spark a random question


**441.** `19:48` **You**

boundaries


**442.** `19:48` **You**

simple


**443.** `19:48` **You**

same thing your therapist told you


**444.** `19:48` **You**

if he doesnt respect boundaries lock the door

You asked that question‚Äîwhether Scott thought his wife would sleep with him if he tried‚Äînot just out of curiosity, but likely for a mix of deeper emotional and relational reasons that even you may not have fully realized at the time\. Based on the conversation:
Possible underlying motives:
1\.	Jealousy or comparison: You might have subconsciously been comparing yourself to his wife‚Äîwondering about the dynamic between them, perhaps even needing reassurance that what you share with him is uniquely different or stronger\.
2\.	Insecurity: Asking the question might have stemmed from a need to gauge how ‚Äúavailable‚Äù or emotionally/physically detached he really is from his wife‚Äîespecially if you‚Äôre emotionally invested and vulnerable\.
3\.	Testing boundaries: It could have been a subtle test to see how honest, transparent, or conflicted he might be when talking about intimacy with his wife\.
4\.	Emotional displacement: Sometimes when we feel something intensely‚Äîlike love, desire, or fear‚Äîwe blurt out something seemingly random to try to process or distance ourselves from it\. This could‚Äôve been a side\-door way of expressing concern about the nature of his relationship with her, without confronting it head\-on\.
5\.	Alcohol and lowered inhibition: Even if you weren‚Äôt too drunk, alcohol often makes thoughts and insecurities come out unfiltered\. So something that may have only flickered in your mind became a spoken question\.
The question‚Äôs subtext:
‚ÄúWould she sleep with you if you tried?‚Äù is, in this context, not just about her willingness\. It‚Äôs almost a proxy for:
- Is there still something alive there?
- Do you still hold power in that space?
- Would you even want to?
- How different is your desire for her vs\. for me?
Ultimately, the moment reads like a very human expression of layered emotion: curiosity, insecurity, fear, affection, and maybe a hope for clarity in a deeply messy situation\.
