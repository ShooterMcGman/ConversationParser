**047.** `08:31` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Nope I would go to other building if I could


**066.** `11:38` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Ps\. Ahana is feeling very lost today so you might need to do a bit extra for her going forward until a new supe in place\. She keeps coming to me for stuff and I told her she can continue to but just be aware\. She is feeling diff than the others\.


**067.** `11:39` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

I told her I‚Äôm not going anywhere and she can always talk to me but still, just realize she is a bit insecure\.


**068.** `11:45` **You**

**074.** `11:46` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

She is much more insecure than the rest of the team


**075.** `11:46` **You**

Yeah I will give her some reassurance I have noticed that in the past


**076.** `11:46` **You**

She reminds me of me


**077.** `13:06` **You**

Hey looked a bit down at the end of
Our chat\.\. you know I am willing to wait if you are right\.\. for whenever we can evolve or whatever you want to call it\.  You just looked a bit dismayed\.


**078.** `13:23` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

I wasn‚Äôt dismayed\. It is always just a reality check whenever we mention the ‚Äúwhen‚Äù in terms of being together finally\. That‚Äôs all\. Not a big deal\.


**079.** `13:24` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

**207.** `22:32` **You**

We could do that\.


**208.** `22:33` **You**

Go up Friday come back Sunday if possible on your end


**209.** `22:33` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

I will see if Andrew is thinking of taking her


**210.** `22:33` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

If so I‚Äôm not going up


**211.** `22:33` **You**

So the other option


**212.** `22:33` **You**

Roadtrip


**213.** `22:33` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Don‚Äôt feel like hanging out with him :p lol


**214.** `22:33` **You**

Well yeah I don't think the three of us would get along


**215.** `22:34` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Unlikely


**216.** `22:34` **You**

So Haris invited me to Windsor end of June to visit clients\.


**217.** `22:34` **You**

26th/27th\. one or both days


**218.** `22:34` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

‚ÄúVisit clients‚Äù


**219.** `22:34` **You**

**220.** `22:34` **You**

**221.** `22:34` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

lol k


**222.** `22:35` **You**

28th I have been invited back to see John as he is getting ordained in Grand Rapids\.


**223.** `22:35` **You**

But we could skip the customer visits


**224.** `22:35` **You**

Haris would cover for me anyways


**225.** `22:35` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

lol


**226.** `22:36` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

*üí¨ Reply*

**227.** `22:37` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Ok so obviously yes I would want to do something\. Just need to figure it out\.


**228.** `22:37` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Will see what Andrew is thinking re: Maelle


**229.** `22:38` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

I normally take her so we will see


**230.** `22:38` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

She won‚Äôt care who takes her tho


**231.** `22:38` **You**

I mean if Andrew isn't well then that would put a crimp in it\.


**232.** `22:39` **You**

but again none of this is set in stone\.\. and it is no biggy if it doesn't work out honestly\.\. just an idea\.


**233.** `22:40` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**
