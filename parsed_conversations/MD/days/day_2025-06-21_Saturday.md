Reaction: üòÆ from Meredith Lamb
1st was/am so excited to see yku my brain wouldnt turn off, then drunk Jaimie called and woke me up\.\. nothing insane just checking in on Gracie but whatever I was awake\.\. then Gracie got the dog all riled up and didn‚Äôt take her out first and teddy had a MASSIVE pee on the bed upstairs so I had had to go strip it including the weighted blanket FUN‚Ä¶ and then wash everything\.  Then I couldn‚Äôt get back to sleep and I whacked
My shin on something going back downstairs\.\. Gracie banged
On my door again because maddie was being mean\.\. then I did 50 push\-ups and 50 sit\-ups and walked around for 10 mins to try to reset and it still took my until literally after 2 am to sleep\.
