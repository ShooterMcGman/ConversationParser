I love you so much Mer\. I just wish I was waking up next to you so I could make sure you are ok\.  You didn‚Äôt deserve any of that last night nor what came before\.  That is something you will never find with me\.  I might not always be able to give you what you need but I swear to god I will give you everything I have to give just to make you happy\.  Ok I have to scrape my ass outta bed and go to the airport\.  Then gym then home then maddie then water heater lol‚Ä¶ then I will wait to hear from you\.  Or maybe you give me another shout\.  If you try push\-ups do them first thing\.  Lock your core flex glutes think about last night and give er\!

I know I feel like shit
Today I am stuck here nothing I can do for you\.\. useless\.\. I was worried because I thought something happened because of how hard
You were both going at it\.  I hate this situation and I hate feeling like this all the time\.

No I just went to sleep üí§ but I‚Äôm questioning a lot this morning


**022.** `09:22` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

**023.** `09:23` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

**028.** `09:24` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

**029.** `09:24` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

I would like to tell them tho


**030.** `09:24` **You**

What he said was a threat and it was used to intimidate you

**076.** `10:59` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

On my drive here I was like ‚Äútoo bad I didn‚Äôt have a driver to just drive me around bc I don‚Äôt like driving‚Äù lol is that mean? Ha


**077.** `11:03` **You**

It is inevitable\.


**078.** `11:03` **You**

And I would happily do it\.


**079.** `11:04` **You**

Would/will


**080.** `11:04` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Lol whatever\. I‚Äôm in a bitchy mood\.


**081.** `11:04` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

I just drove to an appt\. Just a bitchy thought in my head


**082.** `11:04` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

lol


**083.** `11:04` **You**

üôÅ sucks


**084.** `11:04` **You**

**088.** `11:05` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

I do not need a driver


**091.** `11:05` **You**

I don‚Äôt mind driving around


**092.** `11:05` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

I think that is so weird


**093.** `11:05` **You**

It is common in many relationships


**094.** `11:05` **You**

For one to be the primary driver when they drove together


**095.** `11:05` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

>
Says who?

*üí¨ Reply*

**096.** `11:06` **You**

It just is I will got it


**097.** `11:06` **You**

Gpt


**098.** `11:06` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

There is a diff between primary driver and being required to be driven places though


**099.** `11:06` **You**

Mmm I could make her go if I wanted


**100.** `11:06` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

I don‚Äôt think primary thing is weird


**101.** `11:06` **You**

And sometimes I have


**102.** `11:06` **You**

But when I don‚Äôt mind doing it it isn‚Äôt really a chore


**103.** `11:06` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

I know ‚Ä¶


**104.** `11:06` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Funny


**105.** `11:06` **You**

I look at things differently than you


**106.** `11:07` **You**

And not necessarily better


**107.** `11:07` **You**

Most things I do I know why I am doing them\.\.


**108.** `11:08` **You**

The stuff I do for Jaimie now isn‚Äôt because I want to or want to spend time with her\.\. it is because kf
I do she will be just a bit happier and easier to get along with as
We
Continue to separate


**109.** `11:08` **You**

And so far I have had full transparency to all communications with lawyer and been able to structure my own responses etc\.\. I made decisions I\. How pensions would be dealt with and insurance etc\.


**110.** `11:09` **You**

Reaction: üòÆ from Meredith Lamb
I told her about us essentially this morning\.\. not what you would want\.\. but enough so that she got the message and wouldn‚Äôt be surprised when it eventually comes out


**111.** `11:12` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

My Timehop\. Now I feel guilty for taking the day off\. Lol but my mom told me not to go ‚Äúcrazy like last time‚Äù when I told her I started working out again this week so that may have influenced my day off today a bit

*üìé 1 attachment(s)*

**112.** `11:13` **You**

Eesh Lats and everything damn‚Ä¶


**113.** `11:15` **You**

**114.** `11:16` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Look forward to that \(I mean, I have some work to do but will get there\)


**115.** `11:17` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

My time hop is full of ME doing kid shit and Andrew thinks it would be ok for them to be with me on weekends\. Like wtf\. Idiot\.


**116.** `11:18` **You**

Mer\.\. what he said wasn‚Äôt meant to make you think about whether it made sense or not\.\. it was meant to intimidate and hurt you\.\. nothing more\.  He doesn‚Äôt believe that even he isn‚Äôt that fucking stupid\.\. it was a ploy and a poorly thought out line\.


**117.** `11:18` **You**

One\.


**118.** `11:19` **You**

Btw you skipped over the I told Jaimie so I guess you are cool


**119.** `11:19` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Um why?

*üí¨ Reply*

**122.** `11:21` **You**

She said something along the lines again on the drive in of being replaced and I will have a gf like a week after she leaves and I said yeah probably so she knows who\.\. I said I have been lonely for a long time and that isn‚Äôt a dig at
You\.\. but it is true\.\. and I don‚Äôt want to be\.\. I don‚Äôt think anyone should have to be\. No one replaces you\.\. but I do get to choose to keep
Moving forward with whoever I want\.

I think it was said out of anger about the cottage he feeeks trapped and he wants

**128.** `11:25` **You**

Like you she wants done


**129.** `11:26` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Yeah the dragging on and on is probably the worst part of separation I‚Äôm learning\.


**130.** `11:26` **You**

It is\.\. especially when you continue to live together


**131.** `11:28` **You**

Anyhow there will still be covert operations\.\. cannot get around that\. But I don‚Äôt think I will need to wait that long now to let her know or at least respond honestly when asked


**132.** `11:31` **You**

Remember don‚Äôt worry about contraception or no any nonsense I am going to talk to my doc when he is back from vacation\.


**133.** `11:31` **You**

There might be side effects


**134.** `11:50` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Still waiting\. She is very late today\!


**135.** `11:57` **You**

**136.** `11:58` **You**

When they installed the water heater and attached the humidifier the installed it the wrong way and the humidifier cable melted in something hot from the water heater pin hole spraying water everywhere‚Ä¶

**137.** `11:58` **You**

**138.** `12:12` **You**

**139.** `12:15` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Nope done


**140.** `12:15` **You**

Hopefully uneventful


**141.** `12:16` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

**142.** `12:16` **You**

Why


**143.** `12:17` **You**

**144.** `12:18` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

**145.** `12:18` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Proactive


**146.** `12:38` **You**

**147.** `12:38` **You**

And what about this estrogen thing?


**148.** `12:38` **You**

**149.** `12:38` **You**

You are probably driving again\.\. sorry Gracie exploded at me


**150.** `12:49` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Just got home and he is not here\. Ahhhh :\) :\)


**151.** `12:50` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Estrogen is bad for my clotting gene variant\.


**152.** `12:50` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

I have a gene variant that can cause blood clotting\. Found out about it during genetic dna testing while in fertility years ago


**153.** `12:51` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

That‚Äôs what I was testing girls for at sick kids\. Gets passed on from parent


**154.** `12:51` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Relatively new gene discovered in the 80s


**155.** `12:51` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Blood clots cause miscarriages so they test for it in fertility


**156.** `12:52` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

*üí¨ Reply*

**162.** `13:14` **You**

**163.** `13:14` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

**164.** `13:14` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

So she is going to email me re: an iud


**165.** `13:14` **You**

Oh your text
Didnt say that


**166.** `13:14` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

**167.** `13:14` **You**

Ok


**168.** `13:14` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Oh sorry typo\!


**169.** `13:14` **You**

But still that has side effects too I think


**170.** `13:15` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

One of my good friends loves it


**171.** `13:15` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

So depends probably


**172.** `13:15` **You**

I think it cancels your period


**173.** `13:16` **You**

Well the hormonal kids do


**174.** `13:16` **You**

Iuds


**175.** `13:16` **You**

I just don‚Äôt understand


**176.** `13:16` **You**

I am HAPPY to do this


**177.** `13:17` **You**

I am never having more children anyways


**178.** `13:18` **You**

I just don‚Äôt want you to have to go through something that puts you at risk or anything of side effects etc


**179.** `13:19` **You**

Worried


**180.** `13:19` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

She is going to email me\. We will see she doesn‚Äôt insert them so I‚Äôd go elsewhere anyway\. It isn‚Äôt a worry right now\. Nothing in motion\.


**181.** `13:19` **You**

Ok


**182.** `13:20` **You**

*üí¨ Reply*

**184.** `13:37` **You**

ROFL


**185.** `13:38` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

So I was away on the weekend obviously and I have come home and had to clean up cat pee, like three times


**186.** `13:38` **You**

Fun


**187.** `13:38` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

The reason is because our two litter boxes were completely unuseable because I am the only one maintaining anything or taking care of the cats at all


**188.** `13:38` **You**

Yuck yeah


**189.** `13:38` **You**

I get that


**190.** `13:38` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

So I asked him today if we should surrender the cats to a rescue because with me leaving how are they gonna get taken care of?

**221.** `14:09` **You**

**222.** `14:09` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

**223.** `14:09` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

So what was Gracie‚Äôs beef today


**238.** `14:23` **You**

Reaction: üòÆ from Meredith Lamb
Same shit\.\. she wanted wanted wanted\.\. and I said no\.\. she wants me to go spend a bunch of money on stuff\. and I refused\.\. she does nothing to add value\.\. she won't grow up\.\. it got heated\.\. she called Jaimie\.\. she freaked out started smashing something on the floor and we said if she continued she would be removed\.  Good times all around\.


**239.** `14:24` **You**

I mean trust me I don't just sit there meek and mild\.\. I engage and I shouldn't and in the real world I wouldn't  but there is sooooooo much history and shit here it is hard not to\.


**240.** `14:26` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Yeah that is how I feel with Andrew\. Sooooo hard not to engage\. I get it\.


**241.** `14:26` **You**

This is just an impossible situation\.\. and I feel very much a bad father and husband\.\. and I wish I could have done a better job\.\.


**242.** `14:27` **You**

It is what it is though


**243.** `14:27` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Her therapist doesn‚Äôt help at all??


**244.** `14:27` **You**

nope\.\. she doesn't tell her therapist the whole truth


**245.** `14:27` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Ahhh ok yeah that‚Äôs a problem


**246.** `14:27` **You**

see gracie won't own up to it or face it\.\. she blames everyone els


**247.** `14:27` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

But the therapist must know she doesn‚Äôt go to school nor work?


**248.** `14:27` **You**

and until she does\.


**249.** `14:28` **You**

yes

*üí¨ Reply*

**250.** `14:28` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Are they trying to address that


**251.** `14:28` **You**

we wouldn't know


**252.** `14:28` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Gah


**253.** `14:28` **You**

she is 18 and even then we don't have contact with therapist


**254.** `14:29` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Seems a little impossible


**255.** `14:32` **You**

it is J and I agree there is not likely to be any kind of reconciliation between Gracie and I for some time\.\. she needs to really get professional help\.\. I tried to explain that to her\.\. we aren't equipped for this\.\. and she just said she wants compassion\.\. and I said no\.\. that just empowers you to keep doing what you are doing\.\. you need a boot in the ass\.


**256.** `14:32` **You**

and then\.\. well you can guess


**257.** `14:33` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

I think I can guess‚Ä¶\. Smash


**258.** `14:33` **You**

yep


**259.** `14:33` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Compassion


**260.** `14:33` **You**

**261.** `14:33` **You**

but tbh\.\.


**262.** `14:33` **You**

I don't have any\.\. it has been so bad for so long\.\.


**263.** `14:33` **You**

I tried to explain the empty glass concept to her


**264.** `14:34` **You**

but she just says you are my parent and I should be able to do anything\.


**265.** `14:34` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Oh boy


**266.** `14:35` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Maybe you should try family counselling??


**267.** `14:35` **You**

It would never work\.\. again\.\. she cannot face the truth


**268.** `14:35` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Then you can hear what the counsellor says tho


**269.** `14:35` **You**

she has segmented it off, suppressed it\.


**270.** `14:36` **You**

We could\.\. maybe J and her could do it in Moncton


**271.** `14:36` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

It might be money better spent


**272.** `14:36` **You**

I am literally just trying to survive here\.
