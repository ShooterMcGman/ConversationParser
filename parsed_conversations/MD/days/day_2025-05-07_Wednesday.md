**067.** `11:17` **You**

While I believe you and I were meant to be can you see me fitting into your life\.\. like I am just worried I won‚Äôt\.


**068.** `11:17` **You**

Just\. A thought out of our earlier convo


**069.** `11:17` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

üôÑ


**070.** `11:17` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Good response?


**071.** `11:18` **You**

Ummmmmmm mmmmm hmmmmm yes yes‚Ä¶ very interesting\.


**072.** `11:20` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

When I said that I feel like you are home to me, I wasn‚Äôt lying\. Just because I had this particular life for the last few years doesn‚Äôt mean it felt right\. You feel right so I don‚Äôt understand how you couldn‚Äôt fit in to my life honestly\.


**073.** `12:05` **You**

I feel the same
Way but there is you and then there is this massive thing that is your life‚Ä¶ and i guess I just don‚Äôt see where I fit except as the boy you keep off to the side jk‚Ä¶ this is a ways out miles and miles and soooo many miles to go before that is a problem to worry about\.


**074.** `12:06` **You**

My life is small and simple compared\.\. so it is just timing\.\. everything else is easy\.


**075.** `12:06` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

My life is not massive\.


**076.** `12:06` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Omg


**077.** `12:06` **You**

Relatively speaking


**078.** `12:07` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

I mean it is a bit more chaotic bc big family, younger kids, and 1 extra kid\.


**079.** `12:07` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Otherwise same


**080.** `12:10` **You**

I mean yeah it soo sounds the same\.\.


**081.** `12:10` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

I‚Äôm not sure why it matters


**082.** `12:25` **You**

It probably doesn‚Äôt, miles away, just a thought that popped
Into my brain\.


**083.** `12:42` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

You would integrate into my life easily and could probably pull it off better than I can\. You have more energy than I do\.


**084.** `12:43` **You**

As you said I will focus on just integrating with you first that is what I want more than anything else regardless


**085.** `13:02` **You**

Hey I am going to need some me time to process some stuff today so I am not going to attend the team meeting\.


**086.** `13:07` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Totally cool\. We are going to go over your list and status so I will update you at our one on one ‚Ä¶ we can actually talk about work maybe


**087.** `13:08` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

>
My family will like you and there isn‚Äôt any crazy upset people in my family by my whole situation so you will be entering a pretty drama free environment\. Andrew will be the only wild card\.

*üí¨ Reply*

**088.** `13:09` **You**

Sry yeah I moved past that but appreciate it I do want everyone to like me so I can fully be with you\.\. b


**089.** `13:17` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Do you really believe I would treat you as ‚Äúthis boy i keep off to the side‚Äù??? Lol


**090.** `13:18` **You**

My issue is I feel trapped right now and I need to breathe‚Ä¶ so j says just take more trips to Chatham T least the company pays\.\.


**091.** `13:18` **You**

I mean my idea\!\!\! lol


**092.** `13:18` **You**

But I am thinking of finding\. Studio or something


**093.** `13:18` **You**

Just to get the fuck out of the basement for a few months not sure


**094.** `13:19` **You**

Doing the hotel thing
For work isn‚Äôt bad either but it needs to make sense


**095.** `13:19` **You**

But I have to breathe to do something I know I cannot stay there until July\.


**096.** `13:19` **You**

At least not with both her and d grace there


**097.** `13:19` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

You need a mind map


**098.** `13:20` **You**

You need a mind map‚Ä¶


**099.** `13:20` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

üôÑ


**100.** `13:22` **You**

I need a lot of things‚Ä¶ mind maps aren‚Äôt going to cut it\.\. not in this mind\.


**101.** `13:22` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Can you afford a studio


**102.** `13:22` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

You could always just do some short term air bnbs here and there


**103.** `13:23` **You**

I don‚Äôt know maybe I am going to look part of the reason I live at the gym or need to make friends or just something


**104.** `13:25` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

You just want a single Sharon in Whitby who has tons of time on her hands\. üòú


**105.** `13:25` **You**

Sounds about right\.


**106.** `13:25` **You**

As long as we agree Sharon is you\.\.


**107.** `13:26` **You**

Other than that refer to previous statement because that doesn‚Äôt exist\.


**108.** `13:26` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

You never know\. Once you go looking‚Ä¶


**109.** `13:27` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Sowing your oats‚Ä¶


**110.** `13:27` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

:p


**111.** `13:27` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

See where your messages take my head


**112.** `13:27` **You**

It‚Äôs very unfair\.


**113.** `13:27` **You**

I would never do that


**114.** `13:27` **You**

I just need something g to keep me from going insane


**115.** `13:27` **You**

You know what I had to stop doing


**116.** `13:28` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

**117.** `13:28` **You**

I had to stop listening to the mix tape and Morgan wallen\.


**118.** `13:28` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Fair enough


**119.** `13:28` **You**

Because I do that and I cannot stop thinking of you or the dance or any of it\.\. lol


**120.** `13:29` **You**

Which sure if I am you I am maybe super supe reassured that this guy is absolutely in love with me\.


**121.** `13:29` **You**

But S me


**122.** `13:29` **You**

As me


**123.** `13:30` **You**

Like I am just trying to run around trying to find a way to distract myself, to kill time to get me to the next day and the next
Etc


**124.** `13:31` **You**

I know please you wanted me to be honest I didn‚Äôt want to talk about it anymore\.\. lol I am stuck


**125.** `13:31` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

I think once my separation agreement is done in a few weeks and then I‚Äôm in a new place you will feel differently


**126.** `17:08` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Am I going to be getting shocked texts from Jim?


**127.** `17:09` **You**

Nope


**128.** `17:10` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Very supportive as Jim is


**133.** `17:27` **You**

No clue about is that he let I\. To


**134.** `17:28` **You**

You were only mentioned peripherally


**135.** `17:28` **You**

Although he has an interesting observation


**136.** `17:28` **You**

Very astute


**137.** `17:28` **You**

But it is a
Conversation not a text


**138.** `17:29` **You**

Especially when I am driving

**153.** `20:03` **You**

Ok don‚Äôt need to discuss


**154.** `20:04` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Just trying to forget about it\. Very disturbing to keep getting called that and told him it better not be the narrative of our separation\. I will be pissed


**155.** `20:05` **You**

Sorry mer it isn‚Äôt who you are it is how he needs to frame you so he can tolerate himself


**156.** `20:06` **You**

Look we do t have to chat tonight if you need a break\.\.


**157.** `20:07` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Exhausting\. Just cleaning up work emails


**158.** `20:07` **You**

**159.** `20:09` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

**161.** `20:09` **You**

Well it is better discussed but whatever I will try to put in words that make sense


**162.** `20:10` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

You can call me\. I‚Äôm alone in my office


**163.** `21:26` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

If I go to Oshawa Friday night, you want to get together?


**164.** `21:26` **You**

**169.** `21:27` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

**172.** `21:28` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Go away?


**173.** `21:28` **You**

J has told me just take the fuck off air bib or whatever


**176.** `21:28` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Or saying yku staying for that saying I am


**183.** `21:30` **You**

**185.** `21:31` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

So I just need to have them to Oshawa for then

But I can always say I‚Äôm going to spend time with my parents\. Not unusual\. I‚Äôm close with them


**187.** `21:31` **You**

I am good with whatever mer\.


**188.** `21:32` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

I‚Äôm a LITTLE reluctant to say just come to my parents but not fully \(lol spoiled\)


**189.** `21:32` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

It feels a little weird at 47


**190.** `21:32` **You**

I still want to meet your mum but only when you are comfortable


**191.** `21:32` **You**

But I like the idea of a non
