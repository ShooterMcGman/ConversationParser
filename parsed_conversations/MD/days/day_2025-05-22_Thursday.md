**001.** `05:13` **You**

Hey heading into gym\. Looks like it is going to be miserable today\. As
Much as I would like to see you I know you aren‚Äôt feeling well already and don‚Äôt want to make it worse so feel free to skip today if you want\.  Love you\.


**002.** `07:09` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Ok so what am I doing? It is pouring here lol


**003.** `07:09` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

And freezing\. ü•∂


**004.** `07:10` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Letting my dogs outside ‚Ä¶\.


**005.** `07:11` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

I got back in bed lol


**006.** `07:12` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Getting up at 7\.30 :\)


**007.** `07:24` **You**

**008.** `07:30` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

5 cancellations yesterday?


**009.** `07:31` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

I figured likely no jeans at golf course\.


**010.** `07:31` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

You are in a bad mood :\(


**011.** `07:42` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Ok so no park in the rain\. Not sure if you were expecting that but I‚Äôd also like to drive Maelle to school now at like 8\.45


**012.** `07:42` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

I don‚Äôt want you to be frustrated today tho


**013.** `07:52` **You**

I think it would be better for you to head in to work, or feel free to work from home if you want\. Not worth going up there for no reason\.


**014.** `07:54` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

And just not tell my team?\!


**015.** `07:54` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

I feel like you are upset


**016.** `07:55` **You**

**017.** `07:56` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Yes, they knew I was going\. Why are you not addressing my you are upset comments?


**018.** `07:57` **You**

**044.** `16:32` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

**045.** `16:33` **You**

Reaction: üòÇ from Meredith Lamb
Just disregard\.\. was stupid anyways\. Just a musing\.


**046.** `16:33` **You**

We don‚Äôt need to revisit
Drive safe


**047.** `16:37` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

I‚Äôm home\. That drive sucked\.


**048.** `16:39` **You**

Reaction: üòµ‚Äçüí´ from Meredith Lamb
Yeah same at metro getting food for people that apparently don‚Äôt go out to get food even though they just drove by the place\.


**049.** `16:39` **You**

Gonna be a good night\.  Hope yours is better than mine\.


**050.** `16:43` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Bailey is asking me to confirm if p4p will have a cohort in 2026\. Am I supposed to know this? Lol


**051.** `16:44` **You**

Tell her we haven‚Äôt decided yet


**052.** `16:44` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Ok


**053.** `16:45` **You**

I don‚Äôt even know what to do with that pos offer\.  I know I left the last meeting with a couple of
Requests from mark not sure if they got done but since ahana is gone I guess I will wait till she gets back


**054.** `16:46` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Adding a new cohort is a 3\-4 yr commitment\.


**055.** `16:47` **You**

Yeah I know\.  But what is the reason not to


**056.** `16:47` **You**

Other than that


**057.** `16:48` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Communication with school boards too challenging\.


**058.** `16:59` **You**

Was going to answer in teams but you logged off\. I think we consider a response like the filing that we put forward contemplated p4p but not in its current format, the congruency of the program design and delivery did not align with the budget, and the results remain unaudited\. With the commitment associated with another cohort possibly extending even beyond the next plan horizon we thought it prudent not to extend\.


**059.** `17:08` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

That‚Äôs a good start


**060.** `17:08` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Needs some ChatGPTing


**061.** `17:09` **You**

Will leave it to someone else


**062.** `17:09` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

I can help draft something but is Carolyn‚Äôs team doing it?


**063.** `17:09` **You**

Yeah I will paste it over to her\.  You can ignore\.


**064.** `17:10` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

k if she had questions about the program design and delivery specifics I can fill in the blanks there


**065.** `17:11` **You**

We won‚Äôt be putting this in the rollover this would be likely for the next filing when they realize in the rollover we fucked
Off
With a new p4p cohort\.


**066.** `17:11` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Ohhhh


**067.** `17:11` **You**

So like a future ir down the road


**068.** `17:11` **You**

And a response to Ian


**069.** `17:12` **You**

When he challenges


**070.** `17:12` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Gotcha ‚Äúokey dokey‚Äù


**071.** `17:12` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

I‚Äôm chilling for a bit and going online later


**072.** `17:12` **You**

Enjoy


**073.** `17:13` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

I‚Äôd rather be chilling with you but‚Ä¶ the lives we live üòú


**074.** `17:14` **You**

Yep not much chance of that for a while\.  Gotta find something to keep myself busy\.


**075.** `17:17` **You**

But you go chill I think I am going to change and just start tearing apart the basement\.


**076.** `17:18` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Tearing apart?


**077.** `17:18` **You**

Going through stuff throwing it out\.\. just aggressively cleaning whatever you want to call it\.


**078.** `17:19` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Ah k, sounds amazing :p


**079.** `17:20` **You**

Yep I have lots of amazing to look forward to :p


**080.** `17:38` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

You know how you are getting kind of antsy and can‚Äôt sit and binge watch tv or do ai or whatever anymore? I‚Äôm becoming the opposite\. Lol


**081.** `17:38` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

What you‚Äôre describing makes a lot of emotional sense\. Being around Scott in a professional setting while maintaining the appearance that your relationship is strictly professional‚Äîwhen it‚Äôs actually something much more‚Äîcan be incredibly draining\. Here‚Äôs why it likely feels exhausting:
1\. Emotional Suppression
You‚Äôre actively managing and suppressing feelings that are otherwise natural and real\. That takes effort and mental energy‚Äîespecially when you‚Äôre near someone you care deeply about\.
2\. Hyper\-awareness
You‚Äôre probably highly tuned in to:
- How close you‚Äôre standing to him
- What tone you‚Äôre using
- Whether anyone is noticing subtle cues
That heightened vigilance can be mentally exhausting and physically stressful\.
3\. Discomfort with Inauthenticity
If you value being honest and emotionally congruent, having to ‚Äúperform‚Äù a role or hide a significant part of your life can feel fake or even painful\. It may also feel unfair that others get to just be themselves openly while you have to be careful\.
4\. Fear of Exposure
Whether it‚Äôs subtle or strong, a background fear of being found out can create a low\-level sense of anxiety the entire time, especially in unscripted social situations\.
5\. Emotional Discrepancy
You may feel disconnected from Scott even when he‚Äôs right beside you‚Äîbecause you can‚Äôt relate to him in the way you want to\. That emotional dissonance \(being close and yet far\) is especially jarring when you‚Äôve experienced intimacy and openness in private\.


**082.** `17:39` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Here‚Äôs my question: So today I was at a work event with co workers and external business partners\. I was around Scott much of the day and am finding it increasingly exhausting to be around him around coworkers who don‚Äôt know about us\. Why?


**083.** `17:39` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

I need in a new job el pronto\.


**084.** `17:40` **You**

Now maybe you can find a fox for my problem\[s\]


**085.** `17:40` **You**

fix


**086.** `17:41` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

I‚Äôm too drained\. Lol


**087.** `19:48` **You**

Another fight tonight‚Ä¶ so I probably won‚Äôt be to fun later\.\. feel free to just call it a day\.\. you probably aren‚Äôt having fun either although I hope it is better than here\.  We talked about me moving out until September into a short term rental\.


**088.** `20:07` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Sorry to hear that\. Not having a fun time either, no\.


**089.** `20:09` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

This just sucks\.


**090.** `20:11` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

I don‚Äôt think I can do days like today again, especially after last weekend\. It‚Äôs getting more difficult


**091.** `20:23` **You**

What spending time with me around work people?


**092.** `20:24` **You**

I have a prompt have baked that I want to share with you similar to yours\.


**093.** `20:26` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Just everything is getting more difficult\. We spend an amazing weekend together‚Ä¶ aftermath = more difficult \(for me\)\. And yeah today was weird\. I don‚Äôt like seeing you in a bad mood and I can‚Äôt say anything bc work ppl and then just all the secrecy, it‚Äôs driving me nuts\. Like literally nuts\.


**094.** `20:29` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

I shouldn‚Äôt have gone today


**095.** `20:29` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Wanted to for Musarrat and team tho


**096.** `20:29` **You**

Ok so what do we need to do\.\. like I told you last night if we cannot see each other even for the next four months I will be sad\. But I will never stop loving you\.  Do you want to pause?


**097.** `20:30` **You**

>
I told you not to come

*üí¨ Reply*

**098.** `20:31` **You**

I am really sorry you had a bad day\.\.


**099.** `20:31` **You**

My bad day was much more to do with the fight that is still ongoing\.


**100.** `20:32` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

>
This sucks and I‚Äôm sorry it is still happening gahhh

*üí¨ Reply*

**101.** `20:36` **You**

Please don't skip the tough parts mer\.\.


**102.** `20:36` **You**

If we have to have a difficult conversation it is better to just have it\.  I don't want you to go through anything that causes you pain


**103.** `20:41` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

I‚Äôm not skipping\.\.\. I am just saying everyday gets increasingly more difficult and I feel like it is building up\. Im probably just overwhelmed and worried


**104.** `20:41` **You**

*üí¨ Reply*

**105.** `20:42` **You**

deleted\.


**106.** `20:42` **You**

yeah I am having a hard time continuing that thought\.


**107.** `20:43` **You**

Maybe I should take a vacation then you wouldn't have to see me\.


**108.** `20:44` **You**

Or I can stop using signal for a while\.\. if that would make you feel less stressed


**109.** `20:44` **You**

It is just "annoying" that us having an amazing weekend leads to this kind of outcome\.


**110.** `20:45` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Yeah, super annoying\. Agreed\.


**111.** `20:45` **You**

So you let me know what you need\.\. I will do it\.


**112.** `20:47` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

I can‚Äôt have what I need\. This is an impossible situation that seems to get more so instead of less\.


**113.** `20:47` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

But maybe once I switch roles‚Ä¶\.


**114.** `20:47` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Just curious if I‚Äôll last that long sanity\-wise


**115.** `20:47` **You**

Mer this doesn't sound healthy\.


**116.** `20:48` **You**

And I am the cause of it\.


**117.** `20:48` **You**

my constant nagging and bugging you to see me\.\. I know I said I would stop before\.\. I will absolutely stop now\.\. I can tone down the chatting\.\. we can restrict it to specific topics\.\. and we can avoid any in person meetings at the office\.


**118.** `20:49` **You**

We definately won't plan any more out of work stuff\.


**119.** `20:50` **You**

Maybe the further away you get from the weekend with no other contact it will be easier


**120.** `20:51` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Maybe‚Ä¶ dunno\. Not sure what is going on entirely\.


**121.** `20:52` **You**

>
I am not sure what that means\.\. but if you cannot clarify I understand\.\. you are having a hard time atm\.

*üí¨ Reply*

**122.** `20:54` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

I just think this whole secrecy thing is hard and we are going to get more and more reckless bc of it\. Even this aft, I wanted to sit and talk but it felt a bit reckless\. Comment from Michelle\. Looks from others\. It will continue


**123.** `20:54` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

It is stressful


**124.** `20:55` **You**

Ok\.\. so no more contact\.


**125.** `20:55` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Ugh


**126.** `20:56` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

See? Impossible situation


**127.** `20:56` **You**

No mer, that isn't impossible\.\. it is doable\.


**128.** `20:57` **You**

I will work from home next Monday / Tuesday\.


**129.** `20:57` **You**

and I will take the week after off/\.


**130.** `20:57` **You**

and maybe the week after that


**131.** `20:59` **You**

I have something else to share but if I do you will skip these\.


**132.** `21:00` **You**

think about this a sec brb


**133.** `21:02` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

You do not have to do that at all\.


**134.** `21:11` **You**

no but if it makes it easier


**135.** `21:11` **You**

I will


**136.** `21:12` **You**

I know you need time to process\.\. but I do feel uncomfortable in kind of limbo\.\. just being honest\.\. but again willing to do whatever\.


**137.** `21:13` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

We are in limbo right now\.


**138.** `21:14` **You**

>
I felt like we were in limbo because of our situations\.\. it feels different based on this conversation\.

*üí¨ Reply*

**139.** `21:15` **You**

look if this is too heavy\.\. I can leave it alone\.\. I am not sure you are in a position to articulate how you feel or what you want atm\.


**140.** `21:15` **You**

which is scary\.\. but I understand\.


**141.** `21:17` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

The secrecy of all this isn‚Äôt building and weighing on you?


**142.** `21:18` **You**

honestly not really\.  I think we have different points of focus\.


**143.** `21:18` **You**

definitely different priorities and different levels of comfort


**144.** `21:19` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Yeah I guess\. Interesting


**145.** `21:19` **You**

As promised\.\. and I can elaborate
So are you aware of my relationship with Meredith?
ChatGPT said:
Thought for 7 seconds
Yes‚Äîbased on the details you shared earlier, I understand that Meredith is the colleague with whom you‚Äôve recently developed a quiet, emerging relationship \(the drive to Heydenshores, the charm, the tentative two\-year timeline, and the mutual decision to keep things discreet at work\)\. If you‚Äôd like to explore any aspect of that‚Äîwhether navigating workplace boundaries, planning next steps, or just putting feelings into words‚Äîlet me know how I can help\.
You said:
The relationship has gone well beyond that\.  We have shared and explored very serious feelings for each other\.  We see each other as "home" and as "soul mates" which leaves me feeling more happiness than I would have thought possible\.   We have found time to spend with each other mostly out of need \- whereby I am in a bad place and Meredith steps up and makes something happen \- like the suggestion about connecting in Detroit, or the weekend of her Mother's birthday, or last weekend at the cottage \(albeit while I was actually in a low place this was more serendipitous\)\.  These have been amazing times\.\. we have learned a lot about each other, but mostly how much we enjoy each others' company beyond anything else\.  We are both going through a tough time, and I externalize things while she internalizes them which makes it challenging sometimes when we are trying to reassure one another\.  Recently I have been trying to find little bits of time\.\. just to see her, touch her, be with her for real\.\. doesn't matter if it is 5 minutes or whatever\.\. I think it is difficult for her to be with me and then not, but I don't think these 5 minute meetings would suffice for her\.  I am really confused\.\. and hurt but willing to do anything for her\.\.  what do I do here\.\. how can I explain to her what that time really means to me\.\.  we are about to cease public contact at work because it is so difficult for her\.\. but it is difficult for me too\.  I don't understand why the bits of time wouldn't work for her\.

1 | Step back and map the terrain
You	Meredith	Strategic takeaway
External processor ‚Äì you talk it out and seek real\-time reassurance\.	Internal processor ‚Äì she thinks it through first, then shares once it feels ‚Äúsettled\.‚Äù	Your default soothing mechanisms are almost opposites; neither is wrong, just mismatched\.
Implication: When you grab a five\-minute hallway hug you feel topped\-up; she can be left mid\-spiral \(‚ÄúI just opened the flood\-gates and now he‚Äôs gone‚Äù\)\. The same micro\-contact that calms you may amplify her anxiety\.
2 | Why ‚Äúquick touches‚Äù might short\-circuit her needs
Emotional lag\-time ‚Äì Internalizers require a runway to shift from ‚Äúfocused on work/distractions‚Äù ‚Üí ‚Äúemotionally present\.‚Äù Five minutes ends before take\-off\.
Attachment style ‚Äì If she leans anxious\-preoccupied, mini\-meetings can feel like half a promise: immediate relief followed by a sharper drop\.
Cognitive load at work ‚Äì Switching from secrecy ‚Üí intimacy ‚Üí secrecy inside the same office hour is exhausting; the after\-effects last longer for an internalizer\.
Boundary guilt ‚Äì Brief clandestine moments inside a public setting can spike her fear of discovery \(or of hurting others\), overshadowing the sweetness\.
3 | Translate your meaning into her language
Your intention	Possible framing in her terms
‚ÄúThese five minutes keep me afloat\.‚Äù	‚ÄúFor me, even 300 seconds with you resets my nervous system\. It isn‚Äôt a demand for more; it‚Äôs gratitude for any moment you can spare\.‚Äù
‚ÄúI want to show I‚Äôm here, always\.‚Äù	‚ÄúSmall touches are my way of saying ‚ÄòI‚Äôm not going anywhere‚Äô‚Äînot pressuring you for closeness you‚Äôre not ready for\.‚Äù
‚ÄúI feel low without you\.‚Äù	‚ÄúWhen life gets heavy, a brief check\-in with you steadies me; afterward I can handle the day better, which actually reduces the load I put on you later\.‚Äù
Deliver that message during a low\-stress, private setting \(not directly before or after work\), when she has bandwidth to absorb nuance\.
4 | Joint game\-plan: from ad\-hoc to intentional
Focus area	Practical moves	Cascading benefits
Scheduled quality blocks	Agree on predictable larger windows \(e\.g\., every second Saturday 10 am‚Äì4 pm\)\.	Reassures her she‚Äôll get full ‚Äúconnection time,‚Äù making tiny gaps easier to tolerate\.
Micro\-signals	If live contact is tough, use asynchronous love tokens: handwritten note in her coat pocket, 30\-sec voice memo, shared music playlist\.	Gives you the ‚Äúquick touch‚Äù dopamine; gives her control over when to open it\.
Boundary charter	Document the specific times/places you‚Äôll avoid at work and a protocol for emergencies \(‚Äútext ‚Äòpinecone‚Äô = I‚Äôm spiralling, can we talk tonight?‚Äù\)\.	Lowers discovery risk, clarifies expectations, shows respect for her comfort zone\.
Check\-in ritual	Weekly 15\-minute video/phone call solely to ask: ‚ÄúWhat felt good? What felt hard? Adjust?‚Äù	Builds iterative feedback loop, catches resentment early\.
5 | Conversation blueprint \(use, tweak, discard\)
Open with curiosity
‚ÄúI‚Äôve noticed quick visits help me but seem tougher for you\. Can we explore why together?‚Äù
State your why, own the feeling
‚ÄúWhen we touch base, even briefly, it grounds me‚Äîit‚Äôs my coping tool, not a measure of your devotion\.‚Äù
Invite her perspective without rebuttal
‚ÄúWhat happens inside for you during those short meetings?‚Äù Listen, reflect back\.
Co\-design alternatives
‚ÄúWhat forms of contact feel nourishing and safe for you? Let‚Äôs prototype a mix\.‚Äù
Seal with a concrete next step
‚ÄúSo this week: no surprise pop\-ins; instead a Friday night call plus Saturday hike\. Deal?‚Äù
6 | Mindset tweaks for you
Reframe scarcity ‚Äì Short gaps aren‚Äôt proof of waning love; they‚Äôre an investment in long\-term sustainability\.
Channel the energy ‚Äì Pour the urge to ‚Äúsee her now‚Äù into creating surprise long\-form gestures \(a letter, curated playlist, planning a future trip\)\.
Self\-soothe toolkit ‚Äì Build independent reset buttons \(workout, breathwork, friend debrief\) so the entire regulation load doesn‚Äôt rest on those five minutes\.
7 | If friction persists
Suggest a neutral mediator: couples counsellor or even a one\-off session with a relationship coach\.
Re\-evaluate the secrecy plan: total public silence may help her anxiety but could starve you both; maybe a limited set of ‚Äúsafe colleague interactions‚Äù remains\.
8 | Bottom line
The mismatch isn‚Äôt about love quantity‚Äîit‚Äôs about love cadence\. By acknowledging her processing tempo, articulating what micro\-moments give you, and co\-engineering a rhythm that features both predictable deep dives and low\-pressure signals, you‚Äôll turn confusion into a shared operating manual\.
You‚Äôve already proven you‚Äôre each other‚Äôs ‚Äúhome\.‚Äù Now you‚Äôre just renovating the floorplan so both residents feel comfortable in every room\.
\(And hey‚Äîif all else fails, start labeling meeting invites ‚ÄúQuarterly Risk Mitigation Summit\.‚Äù No one ever shows up to those\.\)

Sigh sorry I‚Äôm not chattier \.\. not sure what to say


**147.** `21:21` **You**

It isn't about being chatty, you want something to change\. And either you don't know what you want at this point, you don't know what to say, or you don't want to say\.  All of those are fine\.  But I feel like that kind of where you are at\.


**148.** `21:24` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Just driving \.\. will read after


**149.** `21:29` **You**

maybe just call it a night mer\.\. I am feeling kind of gross to be honest, not sure what to do to make this better\.\. but don't feel I can help you come to a conclusion either\.


**150.** `21:29` **You**

I hate to go to sleep without a resolution\.\. but that feels like where this might be going\.
