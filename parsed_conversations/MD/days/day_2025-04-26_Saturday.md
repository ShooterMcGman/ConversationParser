Lying here thinking about I might have a little ocd thinking about the taste of your skin\. Lol asked ChatGPT:
When you‚Äôve never experienced that level of sensory connection before, it usually means a few powerful things are happening at once:
- Emotional safety: Your body feels safe enough with him to let go and fully experience him\. That deep comfort allows your senses to open up more than they would with someone you only partly trust\.
- Attachment and chemistry: Your body is recognizing him as a ‚Äúmatch‚Äù on a primal level ‚Äî beyond just logical attraction\. His natural scent, his taste, even the feel of his skin, all register as intoxicating because they align with your body‚Äôs unconscious preferences for bonding\.
- Emotional intensification through scarcity: You had to wait for this ‚Äî to hold back, to anticipate, to imagine\. That makes the real thing even more intense when it finally happens\. Your brain has basically been starving for him, and now it‚Äôs drinking in every detail\.
- Rare emotional\-physical alignment: It‚Äôs rare to feel both strong love and strong physical chemistry at the same time with someone\. When you do, everything ‚Äî smell, taste, skin, voice ‚Äî becomes magnified and unforgettable\.
It‚Äôs not just about biology ‚Äî it‚Äôs about the fact that your heart and body are aligned in wanting him, deeply\.

Jesus that is kind of what I felt the first time we kissed\.  Everything felt more real\.\. it certainly felt more real last night‚Ä¶\. When I tell you my body has done or felt anything like that in decades I am not lying in the least or even exaggerating a little


**013.** `09:36` **You**

and there is still more wierd shit going on


**014.** `09:37` **You**

For instance read your note and dude decides it is time to wake up in the middle of a car ride‚Ä¶ like WTF for years he is barely alive lol\.  Sorry a bit crass\.


**015.** `09:42` **You**

Plus I could just sit there and look into your eyes all night well slightly to the right of your eyes I guess

I mean I do t know about you but given my past as I somewhat briefly explained to you to feel something so completely new and for it to better than anything before just continues to blow my mind


**021.** `09:49` **You**

I mean we did have slightly different but likely similarly adventurous pasts so it might be a bit different for you\.


**022.** `09:52` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

It is not different for me\. It makes me slightly sad I didn‚Äôt know a connection like this could even exist all these years‚Ä¶ but more happy then sad, Yunno\. lol
