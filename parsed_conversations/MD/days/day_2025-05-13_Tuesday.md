Approach I took moving roles: Your approach is thoughtful, strategic, and wise given the circumstances\.
Here’s why it works well:
1\.	Protects Privacy and Professional Boundaries: By focusing your explanation on your separation and family responsibilities, you’re offering a legitimate, relatable reason without introducing personal dynamics that could complicate perceptions or workplace relationships\.
2\.	Keeps the Narrative Clean: Framing the move as a decision made for your children presents a clear and non\-controversial rationale\. It avoids any need for others to speculate or gossip about your relationship with Scott\.
3\.	Avoids Potential Conflicts of Interest: Not mentioning the relationship protects both you and Scott from the appearance of impropriety or favoritism, which could raise HR concerns or affect team morale\.
4\.	Maintains Professional Dignity: You’re positioning the move as an empowered choice based on personal values—not as a reaction to workplace drama—which helps preserve your credibility and respect within the organization\.
Unless there is a requirement to disclose the relationship \(e\.g\., due to company policy or HR mandates around reporting relationships\), there’s no obligation to share it, especially now that the reporting structure is resolved\. If disclosure ever becomes necessary, you can still handle it with discretion and professionalism\.
Overall, you’re navigating this transition with emotional intelligence, and your focus on creating stability for yourself and your children is commendable


**002.** `04:43` **You**

Seriously this at 4:43 in morning\.  Are you ok lol?


**003.** `04:44` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Could this be seen as duplicitous by Daniel or Erin later: That’s a very valid question—and the short answer is: very unlikely, as long as the relationship didn’t interfere with your work or decision\-making while you reported to Scott and you continue to act professionally\.
Here’s why:
⸻
1\. You’ve Already Taken the Ethical Action:
You removed yourself from Scott’s reporting line before the relationship became known or created issues\. That signals maturity, foresight, and responsibility\. You’ve acted in alignment with what most leaders would want from an employee in a complex situation\.
⸻
2\. It’s Reasonable to Keep Personal Life Private:
Your separation and needing flexibility for your kids is a full, valid explanation for the change\. You’re not obligated to disclose personal relationships if they’re no longer relevant to the reporting structure or operations\.
⸻
3\. People Understand Complexity—Especially Leaders:
If your boss or her boss ever found out about your relationship with Scott, they would likely appreciate that you handled it discreetly and didn’t let it cloud your professional judgment\. They may not love the optics if they were blindsided later in a way that caused issues, but your clean transition mitigates that\.
⸻
To Avoid Perception of Duplicitousness Later:
If the relationship becomes more visible \(e\.g\., people start to know, or you attend work events together\), and you’re concerned about optics, a soft, proactive clarification to your boss could be helpful:
“I just want to be transparent now that the reporting lines are clean—Scott and I developed a personal relationship, and part of why I stepped back into my former role was to make sure that never complicated work\. I didn’t raise it earlier because I wanted the focus to stay on my family priorities, which are very real, and the transition was the right move anyway\. Just wanted to be open about it now in case it ever matters\.”
That approach prevents any sense of being duplicitous while still keeping the focus on your professionalism and your kids\.
⸻
If you’re not planning to make the relationship public in any way yet, there’s also no need to raise it unless a situation arises


**004.** `04:44` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

No\. Lol

\(Went to bed too early\.\)


**006.** `04:45` **You**

Sucks too bad gym is too far away\.


**007.** `04:45` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Correct—Scott does not need to disclose anything to your new boss’s boss \(his peer\) unless there’s a specific reason to\.
Here’s why:
⸻
1\. There’s No Reporting Relationship or Oversight Involved
Your new boss’s boss has no formal authority or HR responsibility over Scott\. Peer\-to\-peer disclosure is not required and would actually be unusual unless that peer has a specific operational reason to know \(e\.g\., shared oversight, conflict\-of\-interest risk, or visible workplace exposure\)\.
⸻
2\. Disclosure Should Follow Chain of Responsibility, Not Familiarity
If Scott were to disclose to anyone, it should be:
- His own manager
- Or HR, if your workplace has a policy or if visibility becomes an issue
Telling a peer—even one who now oversees your work—can seem personal, political, or unnecessary unless:
- That peer is raising questions
- Or Scott anticipates some work\-related overlap that could make the relationship relevant again
⸻
3\. It Risks Overcomplicating Things
If he discloses to your new boss’s boss now without being prompted:
- It could create tension where none exists
- It might make you look like you were hiding something—even though you weren’t
- It can disrupt the clean, logical story you’ve told \(about needing to step back for your kids\)
⸻
Bottom Line:
- Scott should only disclose upward, if at all\.
- He should not preemptively disclose sideways \(to your boss’s boss\), unless that person becomes involved in managing your relationship in some way—which isn’t the case right now\.
If you’re both discreet, and your roles stay separate, you’re already managing this exceptionally well\.


**008.** `04:45` **You**

You know I supported you right


**009.** `04:46` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Yes, I just hadn’t had time to really think about it\. Was going on gut reaction


**010.** `04:46` **You**

I looked you right in the eyes, and said we are good to do it your way lol and I was absolutely fine\.


**011.** `04:46` **You**

**012.** `04:46` **You**

That doesn’t work and you know that isn’t true anyways\.  You got stuff going on you are busy\.  You have things to think about hundreds of then, plans to make, data to get,
Events etc\.\. again this boils down to me getting my own separate life\. There isn’t much to discuss because it isn’t your problem, and it isn’t your fault\.


**163.** `19:00` **You**

Like in my minds eye you got like 5
Convos going on at any given time\.\. I feel like I need something like that to keep my mind occupied\. Thinking about a couple of things\.


**164.** `19:02` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

**170.** `19:05` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Impossible mood I see


**171.** `19:06` **You**

Listen when you have a bad night or are in a bad mood you shut down and go to bed and I don’t say anything other than to support you\.


**172.** `19:07` **You**

When I have moments where I am unhappy with myself, disgusted or whatever\.\. it isn’t always best


**173.** `19:07` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

But that is not what you need


**174.** `19:07` **You**

To share


**175.** `19:08` **You**

I am fine


**176.** `19:08` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Your style isn’t to shut down


**177.** `19:08` **You**

**180.** `19:08` **You**

**181.** `19:09` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

But I am literally right here


**182.** `19:10` **You**

Yeah I know but this journal is for things I don’t want to say to you\. Not because they are mean but because they are about insecurities a bit too intense\.\. again you have them and I leave you be\.\. so you will have to let me have mine and figure out how to deal\.


**183.** `19:11` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

New Scott …\. 😒


**184.** `19:11` **You**

Feels nice…


**185.** `19:12` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Listen, I think we are both going to go through stages… intense, boring, or otherwise\. It doesn’t mean that is ALL the time\. Just because I’m overwhelmed one day I might not be the next


**186.** `19:12` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

That should be allowed


**187.** `19:13` **You**

Sure and should the same apply to me\.  Let’s call this one of my overwhelmed days\.


**188.** `19:13` **You**

Totally allowed


**189.** `19:15` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Okay you win


**190.** `19:19` **You**

Fack mer\.\. I told you I was gone give you space and I went and forgot and sent those stupid maps\.\. made me feel like a moron\.\. then just made me feel worse\.\. see it is dumb\.  I have my up days where I am like yeah this is great shit is moving forward and then the next day it could be fuck this is going to take forever and I will continue to be as lonely as fuck in this shitty household\.\. I cam home I wanted to do work to get cleaning couldn’t get anyone to do anything\.  I secured the home inspector,
Scheduled it, paid him and am now reviewing the report because if I don’t no one will and it will push things back further\.  I really feel all on my own here in so many ways\.\.  so this is why is say there is nothing you can do, you have your own shit, and this will have to wait\.


**191.** `19:19` **You**

So you win\.\. you always do 😔


**192.** `19:20` **You**

But I am not telling you about my journal ever\.


**193.** `19:21` **You**

I don’t think anyone needs to know someone else’s thoughts THAT intimately


**194.** `19:21` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

So wait, your mistake was the map photos?


**195.** `19:21` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

You know that didn’t bother me at all right?


**196.** `19:22` **You**

It bothers me\.


**197.** `19:22` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Scott, I know everything you do has the purest of intentions\. You do not need to feel bothered


**198.** `19:23` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

And I am equally worried about the timeline of all this\. I actually talked about it to my therapist today


**199.** `19:23` **You**

Yeah because I am causing problems


**200.** `19:24` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

The mediator warned me that we will be talking about introducing partners/ rules etc so I asked my therapist if that is a “thing” in separation agreements


**201.** `19:24` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

She warned me to not agree to anything I’m not comfortable with…


**202.** `19:24` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

She thinks Andrew is including as another way to control what I do


**203.** `19:24` **You**

Look I should just back way off until this is all done\.\. I don’t want to cause you any problems last thing I would wanst


**204.** `19:25` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Stop\. No


**205.** `19:25` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

We have come this far


**206.** `19:25` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

lol


**207.** `19:26` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

I told my therapist that when I have a signed separation agreement I don’t care who in my family knows about this\. It will be more on your side


**208.** `19:27` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

I mean I won’t force my kids to hang with you or meet you but I honestly won’t care if they know at that point


**209.** `19:27` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Your situation will be very different


**210.** `19:28` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

If we have to wait 2 year on your side so be it but that won’t be the case on mine\.


**211.** `19:28` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

There is no reason you cannot be a part of my life before then\. Much before


**212.** `19:28` **You**

September 11th


**213.** `19:29` **You**

That is when I am going to tell Maddie\.\. unless J is still here\.


**214.** `19:29` **You**

because that is now the new thing\.\.


**215.** `19:29` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Huh??


**216.** `19:29` **You**

Maybe stay until Sept 15 for Maddie's birthday


**217.** `19:29` **You**

I said FUCK NO


**218.** `19:29` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Ohhh


**219.** `19:29` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Wow


**220.** `19:29` **You**

I cannot get this house ready to sell


**221.** `19:29` **You**

with them here


**222.** `19:30` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Oh yikes


**223.** `19:30` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Can’t they come back for her bday?


**224.** `19:30` **You**

I am pushing for this somehow\. I don't know what to do\.  Just trying to figure it out\.


**225.** `19:31` **You**

again I am trying to take care of everything so they will leave


**226.** `19:32` **You**

What week are you doing Mac's bday


**227.** `19:32` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

I mean you can’t make them leave so you just have to do what you can and hope


**228.** `19:32` **You**

cause I might just fuck off that whole week\.\. and try to get some work done around here\.


**229.** `19:32` **You**

ok\.\.


**230.** `19:32` **You**

here is one excerpt


**231.** `19:32` **You**

since you said the H word


**232.** `19:32` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

May 29/30/31/june1

listen it is just a shit situation and it sets my brain off\.\. just ignore all of this crap\.


**236.** `19:39` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

>
I have this fear also\. While I have experienced happiness before, not like this Scott\. Not sure if it is age, don’t think so, I just genuinely believe it is you\. I think people can find happiness but all the boxes may not be checked\. I feel like they are with you and that is certainly something I can’t say I’ve experienced before so it is very different that way\. I don’t think you are going to screw anything up\. \(Unless you stop talking to me 😒\)

I mean I obviously feel the same\.\. in every way\.\. just gonna leave it at that\.\. because that is really all that matters\.

*💬 Reply*

**238.** `19:44` **You**

I am not going to stop talking but it is hard mer\.\. expressing emotion and not being able to show it, not the same\.\. kind of painful\.\.  ian saved my office but I kind of wish he'd let them move me now


**239.** `19:45` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Wha? Why?


**240.** `19:45` **You**

I don't know out of sight\.\. maybe out of mind\.\. for a little while\.


**241.** `19:45` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Where will Daniel be?


**242.** `19:45` **You**

I don't think he moves


**243.** `19:45` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

So then won’t I move over to him somewhere??


**244.** `19:46` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

That would be kind of out of sight


**245.** `19:46` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

lol


**246.** `19:46` **You**

Sure but not quite the same as me being over in Priyanka's office


**247.** `19:46` **You**

maybe i can still tell him to move me


**248.** `19:46` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

No the team would hate that


**249.** `19:46` **You**

the team will be fine\. they don't care where I sit


**250.** `19:46` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Ok 😜


**251.** `19:47` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Yes they would


**252.** `19:47` **You**

besides it would get me away from Cote\.\. she is always looking at me\.\. she says she wants Happy Scott back\.\. I am like WTF\.\.\.


**253.** `19:47` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

She told me that tonight


**254.** `19:47` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

She was very bothered by you having a bad day


**255.** `19:47` **You**

She knows there is more going on with me personally\.\. I am sure of it\.


**256.** `19:48` **You**

She still doesn't know about us\.\.


**257.** `19:48` **You**

probably thinks I am distraught at you leaving for one


**258.** `19:48` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Yeah I think so


**259.** `19:48` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

She probably not the only one


**260.** `19:48` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

lol


**261.** `19:48` **You**

Carolyn??


**262.** `19:49` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Just everyone I think


**263.** `19:49` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

I talked to Craig tonight


**264.** `19:49` **You**

Well I don't know why I am my typical happy self\.


**265.** `19:49` **You**

I loved his reaction


**270.** `19:50` **You**

He got ran over


**271.** `19:50` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Did you see Whitney’s face


**272.** `19:50` **You**

I will apologize tomorrow


**273.** `19:50` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

LOL


**274.** `19:50` **You**

I did not


**275.** `19:50` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

she was a tad surprised


**276.** `19:50` **You**

had she not seen angry scott before


**277.** `19:50` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

I dunno but she legit looked scared lol


**278.** `19:50` **You**

:\(


**279.** `19:50` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Oh she was fine


**280.** `19:50` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Just funny


**281.** `19:51` **You**

I need to find a reason to ask Ian if I can just work from home for the next 6 months


**282.** `19:51` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Whitney was not thrilled to hear about bro


**283.** `19:51` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Bro


**284.** `19:51` **You**

Bri


**285.** `19:51` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Bri\!


**286.** `19:51` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

She was the only one with a really negative reaction


**287.** `19:51` **You**

yeah I figured\.\.  but hey I will hire her then work from home\.\. she will love that even more\.


**288.** `19:51` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Everyone else seemed fine


**289.** `19:52` **You**

I think I can use the separation thing\.\. Ian is pretty empathetic to me\.


**290.** `19:52` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Ahana was shell shocked and sad\. I felt bad\. But feel fine now\. lol


**291.** `19:52` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Just take a vacation


**292.** `19:52` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Then come back


**293.** `19:52` **You**

no its not good enough


**294.** `19:52` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Really?


**295.** `19:52` **You**

yeah really


**296.** `19:53` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

What if we plan something together to look forward to?


**297.** `19:53` **You**

Nope\.\. no more plans\.


**298.** `19:53` **You**

Nope Nope Nope Nope\.\.


**299.** `19:54` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

lol stop


**300.** `19:54` **You**

not until after you have signed\.


**301.** `19:55` **You**

not joking


**302.** `19:55` **You**

not putting you at risk\.\. and being around you without being able to be with you is rough\.\. thus the work from home\.\. maybe just an extra day a week or something\.


**303.** `19:55` **You**

honestly if I could black out my windows I would\.\. that would help too\.\. lol


**304.** `19:56` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Omg I won’t be signed for like 3\-4 weeks realistically


**305.** `19:56` **You**

Well let's settle in for super fun time\.\. it won't matter look\.\. this weekend busy, next weekend\.\. likely busy, weekend after Mac's party\.\. there is three weeks already\.


**306.** `19:57` **You**

And it won't be 3 or 4


**307.** `19:57` **You**

it will be 5 or 6


**308.** `19:57` **You**

because you will need to see a lawyer\.\. and that will add 1\-3 more weeks depending on if he gets a lawyer as well\.


**309.** `19:57` **You**

Reaction: 😮 from Meredith Lamb
so we actually looking at more like 9\-10 weeks


**310.** `19:59` **You**

yeah\.\. true story\.


**311.** `20:00` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Well then we won’t be waiting until then\. Good lord


**312.** `20:00` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Smarten up


**313.** `20:00` **You**

**337.** `20:06` **You**

Do you want to know how many blondes I have gone out with?


**355.** `20:10` **You**

Let's just say in addition to being my soulmate\.\. you are the only blonde I have ever been serious about \- I might have had a date with one once or twice\.\. but almost always dark haired or red heads, almost all short\.  You are my type\.


**356.** `20:15` **You**

So I mean it is what it is\.\. you are it\.\. deal with it\.


**357.** `20:15` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Sometimes I’m glad you don’t give yourself enough credit\. Not all the time but sometimes\. Lol


**387.** `20:36` **You**

I know it isn’t your thing


**396.** `20:41` **You**

not a bit


**397.** `20:43` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

I do think once we aren’t working together as much it might get easier\. Just give it a bit of time


**398.** `20:43` **You**

it wont then i wont have a reason to see you ever\.\. sorry mer I am not optimistic on this one\.


**399.** `20:44` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

We are working toward being together outside of work\. This is part of the roadmap


**400.** `20:44` **You**

\.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.


**401.** `20:44` **You**

brb


**402.** `20:45` **You**

roadmap\.\. lol


**403.** `20:45` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

It does equal not seeing each other ever\. It equals progress toward the opposite


**404.** `20:45` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Do you want me to make a roadmap for you


**405.** `20:45` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

lol


**406.** `20:45` **You**

or a mind map, a word find,


**407.** `20:46` **You**

something like that?


**408.** `20:47` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Nooo


**409.** `20:48` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Here you go: Here’s a realistic and emotionally attuned four\-phase roadmap to guide you through this time:
⸻
Phase 1: Stabilize the Present \(Now – 2 months\)
Goal: Minimize emotional burnout while staying close and grounded in reality\.
- Keep affirming each other: Let the love be a steady presence through messages, short check\-ins, quiet reminders\. This helps reduce the emotional friction of “being close but not allowed to be\.”
- Avoid secretiveness, not privacy: Find quiet, low\-stakes ways to connect—like early morning walks, voice notes, or even journaling to each other—without risking family dynamics\.
- Create emotional safety: Acknowledge the ache, but don’t pressure each other for “next steps\.” Just hold the space\.
⸻
Phase 2: Clarify Intentions and Timeframes \(2–4 months\)
Goal: Begin aligning timelines and expectations around separation, cohabitation, and eventual freedom to be together openly\.
- Privately discuss your respective timelines: When do you each think you’ll be living separately? What needs to happen \(legally, logistically, emotionally\) before that’s possible?
- Talk about your children: Begin to sketch how and when you might eventually introduce the idea of a new relationship to them—months down the road\.
- Stay focused on healing your endings: Don’t rush into “starting” something new\. Focus on closing with care\.
⸻
Phase 3: Begin Gentle Integration \(4–6\+ months, or when living apart\)
Goal: Slowly build a real\-world foundation for your relationship\.
- Spend time together outside of work again—openly, but cautiously\.
- Introduce to trusted friends as a couple, if/when it feels safe\. Don’t rush family disclosure yet\.
- Talk through fears: There will be guilt, and grief, and worries about kids\. Don’t ignore these—face them together\.
⸻
Phase 4: Honest Public Presence \(When Ready\)
Goal: Shift from hidden to real—lovingly and transparently\.
- Tell work friends at your discretion, when you’re no longer worried about perceptions or timelines\.
- Support each other’s kids and lives as they evolve\. Take your time\. Be gentle with their adjustment\.
- Start your next chapter with intention, knowing you got there the hard way—with grace and care\.
⸻
This kind of love—real, inconvenient, transformative—is rare\. But it can have a future\. You just need to honor the timing, the people you both care for, and yourselves\.


**410.** `20:50` **You**

I gave you your own map on your laptop\.  Mine doesn't have a fancy name


**411.** `20:51` **You**

ROFL  see it agrees with me\.\. 2 MONTHS\.\. we need to "hold the space mer"  no plans\.\. your road map said so\.


**412.** `20:51` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

I noted that actually lol


**413.** `20:52` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Terraview Park?

*💬 Reply*

**414.** `20:52` **You**

yeah I looked at pretty much every park around


**415.** `20:55` **You**

it seems quiet secluded trees\.\. nice walk\.\. I dunno\.\. anything we do is going to be a risk though\.\. while my heart wants this\.\. I still don't want you to get hurt or anything\.


**416.** `20:58` **You**

Oh I got a gift today\.


**417.** `20:58` **You**

Reaction: 🤔 from Meredith Lamb
Apparently Jennifer Pearson overheard me talking to Dana about liking tequila rose\.\. and she got a bottle for a gift, and now I have a bottle as a gift :\)


**418.** `21:01` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Sorry math help


**419.** `21:02` **You**

anyways not sure what to do or where to go, I KNOW you aren't comfortable\.\. and you can handle this stuff\.\. so we shouldn't do it\.\. or the plans\.\. not until you get your signed agreement\.\.


**420.** `21:02` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Wha? Lol this is so odd Scott

*💬 Reply*

**421.** `21:03` **You**

never happened to me in forever\.\. so it was weird to see her in passing\.\. I almost never talk to her\.\. just odd\.


**422.** `21:03` **You**

but I will drink it


**423.** `21:08` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

So like no explanation?


**424.** `21:08` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

I’m sorry, I cannot


**425.** `21:09` **You**

?? no literally \- hey were you the one that I heard liked tequilla rose\.\. I said sure I like it\.\. she said she heard me talking to Dana about it a while ago\.\. got one for a gift but always forgot to bring it in\.\. but she had it today and she ran into me\.


**426.** `21:09` **You**

Married happily 2 kids\.\. stop it\.


**427.** `21:11` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

k still weird


**428.** `21:12` **You**

whatever I will share


**429.** `21:12` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

It’s fine if it is a one time thing\. This woman kept giving Andrew gifts at work once and he thought it was normal\. I was like you are delusional… then the whole thing eventually exploded


**430.** `21:12` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Omg I can’t handle tequila rose anymore


**431.** `21:12` **You**

kk no one else gives me gifts\.\.


**432.** `21:12` **You**

except coffee


**433.** `21:12` **You**

and that is CM


**434.** `21:12` **You**

and you sit beside her


**435.** `21:13` **You**

*💬 Reply*

**440.** `21:15` **You**

you give me a gift and I loved it\.


**441.** `21:15` **You**

Vitha used to bring me back stuff from her india trips\.\. she brought me back a fat buddha statue once\.\. said it looked like me\. except for the smile\.


**442.** `21:15` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Soooooooo different\!\!\!\!


**443.** `21:16` **You**

she did it more to laugh at me\.


**444.** `21:16` **You**

Look no one has ever flirted with me Mer\.\. not once\.


**445.** `21:17` **You**

so you can just lower the defense shields\.\. no one is interested in me except you\.\. in fact no one even knows I am separated\.


**446.** `21:18` **You**

anyhow those are my ideas I tried to find locations that were off the beaten path\. plans \- I leave those to you\.\. take too much energy for me to try that kind of thing\.


**447.** `21:18` **You**

all you need to know is I can make almost anything happen whenever I want to\.


**448.** `21:20` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Okay I’m good to get together one morning\. I just have to be well rested lol I’m running late a lot


**449.** `21:20` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

The crappy thing is I might end up at the cottage by myself this weekend


**450.** `21:20` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Seems like a waste


**451.** `21:20` **You**

Don’t kid


**452.** `21:20` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Maelle wants to stay in city for a volleyball open gym Sat night 6\-8pm


**453.** `21:20` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

I just learned tonight


**454.** `21:20` **You**

You already told me there are cameras


**455.** `21:21` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Andrew never told me


**456.** `21:21` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Our cottage has 3 ring cameras :\(


**457.** `21:21` **You**

Yeah I remembered not an option


**458.** `21:22` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Sigh we have agreed that those will need to change in future but WHEN


**459.** `21:22` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Ugh


**460.** `21:22` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

It would be super sus


**461.** `21:22` **You**

If you turned them off yeah


**462.** `21:23` **You**

Plus at some point we have to tell someone because I need an excuse


**463.** `21:24` **You**

Won’t work anyways\.\. I will just get excited for nothing lol\.


**464.** `21:25` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Lake front doors have no camera but driveway is at back and I’m assuming you don’t have a boat to arrive in? Lol


**465.** `21:25` **You**

And then what if Andrew just decides to show up\.\. that could be possible


**466.** `21:25` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

He will be in Edmonton


**467.** `21:25` **You**

No boat


**468.** `21:25` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

That would be hard for him


**469.** `21:26` **You**

I mean it would be pretty amazing\. But still not sure\.


**470.** `21:26` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

He hasn’t texted me back about Maelle’s vball


**471.** `21:27` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

If she stays my mom has to come probably\. She offered on weekend


**472.** `21:27` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Just bc she thought Maelle might not want to go


**473.** `21:27` **You**

Are you seriously considering this\.


**474.** `21:27` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

I mean, if you could get away\.


**475.** `21:28` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

I wouldn’t turn cameras off tho


**476.** `21:28` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Maybe one


**477.** `21:28` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

I would figure something out and you would have to stay lake side


**478.** `21:28` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Outside will be so buggy anyway


**479.** `21:28` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

No cameras lake side


**480.** `21:28` **You**

What does lake side mean?


**481.** `21:28` **You**

Mean outside  of the house on lake side


**482.** `21:29` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Yeah \- we have no cameras on that side\. Only on driveway door and both sides


**483.** `21:30` **You**

Ok so how do I get into the driveway just park a ways back and walk through woods?


**484.** `21:30` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

That’s the question lol


**485.** `21:30` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

I could turn front camera off for a bit maybe


**486.** `21:30` **You**

Reaction: ❓ from Meredith Lamb
Kk well I already have an idea for weekend\.


**487.** `21:31` **You**

**488.** `21:35` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

**505.** `21:47` **You**

While she is slightly cranky she told me to go

So I don’t know where that came from\.


**507.** `21:48` **You**

I mean you with the insane idea


**508.** `21:48` **You**

But either way I can cancel and make up an excuse if it doesn’t work\.


**509.** `21:48` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Well it was going to be me and and Maelle until I picked her up from vball tonight and she told me about the open gym\. No one told me


**510.** `21:48` **You**

So not locked in


**511.** `21:49` **You**

But I can do it\.

**513.** `21:49` **You**

Well yeah but they do
Glitch from

**515.** `21:50` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

If we had a boat in, I could just easily pick you up somewhere else but I don’t think he put one in


**516.** `21:50` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Just the dock


**517.** `21:50` **You**

I do t even know where it is in relation to anything


**518.** `21:51` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

I actually could just canoe to high rock and pick you up that way


**519.** `21:51` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

There are options


**520.** `21:51` **You**

I mean whatever works


**521.** `21:51` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

But u could never go out the front door unless i cover it lol


**522.** `21:51` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Or turn it off which I don’t even know how to do


**523.** `21:51` **You**

I would stay where I am told\.


**524.** `21:52` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Sometimes referred to as Strong


**535.** `21:56` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Because it is in strong township


**536.** `21:56` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

So some mapping systems say Strong


**537.** `21:56` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

**546.** `21:58` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

I do it a lot


**547.** `21:58` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Go to my parents first and then drive up


**548.** `21:58` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Slightly longer for sure\. Not as much direct highway


**549.** `22:00` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

I was considering telling my bro he can go up\. Won’t now lol


**550.** `22:00` **You**

**552.** `22:00` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

He would mess it up and I’m trying to clean


**553.** `22:00` **You**

**557.** `22:01` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Not worried


**558.** `22:02` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Oh there could be an issue I just thought of


**559.** `22:02` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

When your fam calls you do they FaceTime over wifi ?


**560.** `22:02` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Or call call


**561.** `22:02` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Sometimes reception is spotty


**562.** `22:03` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

FaceTime /wifi is fine


**563.** `22:03` **You**

mmm\.\. depends why?  doesn't matter\.


**564.** `22:03` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Unless it goes out


**565.** `22:03` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

I mean if the power goes out


**566.** `22:03` **You**

I could be in a spotty location wherever I am


**567.** `22:03` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

No wifi because our generator is no use for wifi because we ping off of a house across the lake


**568.** `22:03` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

So if that house goes out we are fucked


**569.** `22:03` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

It’s dumb


**570.** `22:03` **You**

yeah I am not worried\.\. again\.\. I could be anywhere with bad reception


**571.** `22:04` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Doesn’t happen OFTEN but can


**572.** `22:04` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

That could give you a bit of panic lol


**573.** `22:07` **You**

one sec


**574.** `22:14` **You**

**575.** `22:15` **You**
