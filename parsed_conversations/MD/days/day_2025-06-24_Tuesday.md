**059.** `09:31` **You**

Prolly smart tbh not optimal but within budget and you only have to do a year


**060.** `09:32` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Yeah I told Diana and she seems happy


**061.** `09:50` **You**

I mean it is nice to have that support right nearby


**062.** `09:50` **You**

How far from current house?


**063.** `09:50` **You**

Like walk across park or something isn‚Äôt it


**064.** `09:54` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Yup literally that close


**065.** `10:00` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

So what do I wear on Saturday? Is this like wedding dressy? Do I have to buy something? What are you wearing


**066.** `10:40` **You**

Probably khaikis and a dress shirt or collared golf shirt with dress shoes


**067.** `10:56` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

So not wedding dressy


**068.** `12:02` **You**

Reaction: üòÇ from Meredith Lamb
Since Jessica is also a clergy person, she will be wearing a robe and stole\.
In the Episcopal Church, the ordination of a priest is a big deal and some people highlight the significance of that in their attire\. Other people don‚Äôt give a shit and wear whatever\.
However, I would certainly never want you to feel embarrassed because you felt underdressed\. Based on what I know about you, I think you would feel most comfortable with khakis and a button\-down shirt‚Ä¶ Throw on a jacket if you like Jessica will wear a dress\. I‚Äôm so Meredith may want to take this chance to have a little fun with what she wears Keeping in mind that we‚Äôre going to church and not the club\.ü§£


**069.** `13:55` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Meredith is no fun ever in what she wears\. :\)


**070.** `15:00` **You**

ROFL

Like you might be cranky when I walked by\.\. I tend to elicit that look from many people so I woildnt be surprised


**072.** `15:03` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

I have a head ache but am fine lol


**073.** `15:03` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Rough night


**129.** `21:34` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Just overwhelming and Andrew wants spousal to go down $100k


**130.** `21:34` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

So lump sum of $214k instead of $330k


**131.** `21:35` **You**

You are going to have to push back and hard and mean\.\. and mean it unless you are
Willing to do what he wants\.\. he is just going to keep beating on you I feel\.\. and I am sorry he is doing it\.


**132.** `21:53` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Well he is saying he is doing the high end of child so should be lower on spousal


**133.** `21:53` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

It‚Äôs hard to know what is right because his income is so high that the tables don‚Äôt work


**134.** `21:54` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Can I use you as a reference on my application for rental\. Would that be weird


**135.** `21:54` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

See what the mediator suggests\.\. she suggests 12 years\.\. your answer that seems reasonable to me timid the mid point

*üí¨ Reply*

**139.** `22:06` **You**

He tries to push x for 4% ask the mediator what the standard is\. Then agree maybe with something in the middle


**140.** `22:07` **You**

If he is doing 8 years out him big end on both of 12 maybe mid?


**141.** `22:07` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

The 214k is based on 12 yrs


**142.** `22:07` **You**

I dont think you agree to anything


**143.** `22:07` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

I‚Äôm going to ask him tonight why the floor and not in the middle


**144.** `22:07` **You**

Just tell him you are tired


**145.** `22:08` **You**

And that this is why you have a mediator


**146.** `22:08` **You**
