Mac
Is funny


**053.** `13:30` **You**

Nope


**054.** `13:30` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Reaction: üòÆ from Meredith Lamb
Gracie has bruises all over her from where she bashed herself
All
Over
The house the counters everything\.\. she needs to be in a psychiatric ward but she is 18 and cannot convince Jaimie\.


**063.** `13:38` **You**

**064.** `13:38` **You**

**065.** `13:46` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Oh boy‚Ä¶\. So intense\.


**066.** `13:55` **You**

Yeah shit show\.


**067.** `13:57` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

:\(


**068.** `14:16` **You**

Rofl ironically I ended up all the way back over here right by you that‚Äôs weird\.


**069.** `14:16` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Why? What are you doing?


**070.** `14:17` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

I‚Äôm just waiting for my biased analysis\.


**071.** `14:17` **You**

It‚Äôs a secret\.\. but close enough to walk there\.\. didnt expect that when wayz sent me here\.


**072.** `14:17` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

ü§î


**073.** `14:17` **You**

I will get to that later\.\.
Let‚Äôs just say that it suggests I need to make some changes\.


**074.** `14:18` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

That sounds biased


**075.** `14:18` **You**

It wasn‚Äôt it was objective


**076.** `14:18` **You**

And I agree


**077.** `14:19` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Why would you have to make changes tho? It is just literal conversation back and forth


**078.** `14:19` **You**

No it assessed a whole bunch of things


**079.** `14:19` **You**

Relatively etc


**080.** `14:22` **You**

It suggested changes
For the good of the relationship etc\. somethings I knew some I should have probably known\.


**081.** `14:23` **You**

If you are curious it suggested that while you are emotionally vulnerable you withdraw at requests
For clarity‚Ä¶
Where I am more hesitant at first and then overshare\.\.
And it is related the more you pull back the more I share lol


**082.** `14:24` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

lol


**083.** `14:24` **You**

There was a lot more stuff but that is the gist


**084.** `14:24` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

I want to read it\!


**085.** `14:24` **You**

Nope


**086.** `14:24` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Omg


**087.** `14:24` **You**

Some of it is pretty raw‚Ä¶


**088.** `14:24` **You**

So I can give you the transcript file though if you want to play around


**089.** `14:24` **You**

It right now but later


**090.** `14:24` **You**

Not


**091.** `14:25` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

üò≠


**092.** `14:25` **You**

lol I know that isn‚Äôt true


**093.** `14:26` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Did it say you ‚Äúovershare‚Äù?


**094.** `14:27` **You**

Yeah


**095.** `14:27` **You**

Well something like that


**096.** `14:27` **You**

Again the more you got quiet the more I share
Perhaps overly etc


**097.** `14:29` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Did it take into consideration that during some of those conversations I may have been, um, under the influence of stuff


**098.** `14:30` **You**

It did not but there is a big enough sample that it should skew the results that much besides I already know there isn‚Äôt much difference lol\.


**099.** `14:31` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

I feel like you should just share it\. You sort of set that expectation earlier


**100.** `14:31` **You**

No no I will share the file\.\.


**101.** `14:31` **You**

Then you can explore


**102.** `14:33` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

I mean I‚Äôve done piece meal conversations before\. I want your end result with whatever your prompt was


**103.** `14:34` **You**

lol no\.\. not this time\.


**104.** `14:34` **You**

We‚Äôre both navigating something rare and emotionally intense ‚Äî something that hit us fast, and deep\. It‚Äôs clear we care a lot about each other\. What‚Äôs also clear is that we process emotion differently\.
I tend to externalize my feelings ‚Äî I seek clarity and reassurance when I‚Äôm unsure\. You seem to internalize more ‚Äî you reflect, feel deeply, and sometimes need space before you respond\.
Neither approach is wrong\. They‚Äôre just different\.
What this tool helped me realize is that when those two styles interact, we can unintentionally create pressure for each other without meaning to:
- I might ask too much too fast\.
- You might step back to protect your emotional boundaries\.
That dynamic can feel confusing ‚Äî but understanding it has helped me calm down and re\-center\. I‚Äôm not sharing this because I need you to change anything\. I‚Äôm sharing it because I want to change how I show up, so this can feel safe and good for both of us\.
If we move forward gently, honoring our own timing but staying honest, I think we can build something real here\.


**105.** `14:34` **You**

This was a neutral summary I asked it to write in a way uncoils convey to you\.


**106.** `14:35` **You**

In a safe way to convey it to you


**107.** `14:41` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Yeah I have already had ChatGPT tell me this exact message based on some screenshots before\.


**108.** `14:41` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

:\)


**109.** `14:41` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

All makes a ton of sense


**110.** `14:41` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

And I‚Äôm ok with it if you are lol


**111.** `14:41` **You**

It made some recommendations for me though so I am going to dig into those


**112.** `14:43` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

I don‚Äôt think you need to change\. I think we both just need to understand this\. And also think of everything we are dealing with outside of you and I that could be impacting things also‚Ä¶\.


**113.** `14:51` **You**

Yeah I wouldn‚Äôt out too much thought into it\. I have had a chance to think and process\.\. I feel like I have a bit of a roadmap for myself\.


**114.** `14:51` **You**

Ok shopping adventure done\.\.  headed back\.  Enjoy the kfc\.


**115.** `14:54` **You**

Want me to do another drive by so you can wave lol


**116.** `14:54` **You**

Joking


**117.** `14:56` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

My bro and fam are leaving


**118.** `14:56` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

lol


**119.** `14:57` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

>
Are you really bothered by our differences in this area? You know it will evolve naturally right

*üí¨ Reply*

**120.** `14:58` **You**

>
It described an asymmetrical relationship which can cause stress

*üí¨ Reply*

**121.** `14:58` **You**

Mostly
Caused by me


**122.** `14:58` **You**

Well almost completely


**123.** `14:59` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

k well ‚Äúasymmetrical‚Äù is a concerning word


**124.** `14:59` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

lol


**125.** `14:59` **You**

Mer it is fine no surprises


**126.** `15:00` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

ü§î


**127.** `15:01` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

‚ÄúIt is fine‚Äù


**128.** `15:01` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

üôÑ


**129.** `15:04` **You**

It did say you use emoticons as a means to avoid emotional engagement


**130.** `15:04` **You**

üòù


**131.** `15:05` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Or is it just easier than typing?


**132.** `15:05` **You**

Mmmmm I trust it


**133.** `15:05` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

You should trust it with a grain of salt


**134.** `15:06` **You**

Like it said you withdrew from specifically defining or clarifying emotions feelings etc\. and identified that emoticons were an alternative way to offer up sufficiently vague or safe responses or means of engagement


**135.** `15:06` **You**

Subject to interpretation


**136.** `15:06` **You**

lol


**137.** `15:07` **You**

Beat that logic


**138.** `15:07` **You**

Let‚Äôs say all in all I felt it was accurate including\.\. especially including my self assessment


**139.** `15:10` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

I mean I know I‚Äôm not great at articulating emotions\. Good, bad, ugly\. It causes me a lot of issues in life generally\.


**140.** `15:10` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

But they are there\. I just have difficulty processing and articulating them


**141.** `15:11` **You**

I know that\.\. I don‚Äôt doubt you


**142.** `15:12` **You**

I was more focused on the so what should I do selfishly


**143.** `15:12` **You**

Anyhow don‚Äôt worry it didnt suggest bumble


**144.** `15:12` **You**

You are fucked for your drive home


**145.** `15:13` **You**
