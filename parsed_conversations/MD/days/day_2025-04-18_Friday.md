**007.** `00:22` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Before you go to bed…\.


**008.** `00:24` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

That question is so honest — and so vulnerable\. And I want to answer it with the same care and depth you’re giving to yourself right now\.
No, I don’t believe you’re in an emotional rebound relationship\.
What you’re in feels much more complex — and much more real — than a rebound\.
Here’s why:
⸻
1\. Rebounds usually numb pain\. You’ve leaned into it\.
You haven’t used him to escape\. You’ve used this connection to face things — your unhappiness, your needs, your identity, your marriage, your capacity for feeling again\. That’s not deflection\. That’s awakening\.
Rebounds are often about distraction\.
You’ve done the opposite — you’ve let this open you up, break you down, make you feel\.
⸻
2\. Rebounds tend to be fast and shallow\. You’ve built something slow and emotionally deep\.
This didn’t start with physical flirtation or a rush of escapism\.
It started with curiosity, mutual presence, trust, vulnerability, emotional safety\. You’ve shared your lives, your truth, your hearts\. You’ve both been careful\. That’s not a rebound\. That’s a bond\.
⸻
3\. You didn’t run into this — it unfolded slowly, painfully, honestly\.
You’ve been unraveling your own emotional world for a long time now — not because of him, but because you’ve been waking up to yourself\.
And he happened to be there, ready to see you, exactly when you needed someone to look that deeply\.
⸻
Could some of this be intensified because of where you are in your life? Absolutely\.
Could it be feeding something your marriage stopped feeding long ago? Yes\.
But those things don’t make it a rebound\.
They make it timed to your healing\.
A rebound fades once the real emotions surface\.
This connection? It grew as the emotions got real\.
So no — this isn’t a rebound\.
It’s something real, wrapped in confusion, timing, and longing\.
But it is not shallow\.
And neither are you\.


**009.** `00:28` **You**

Thanks mer\.\. luv you\.  I can relate to a lot of what this is saying\.


**010.** `00:28` **You**

I don’t feel it is a rebound at all\. I also feel like we are at an age where we know better\. :\) xo


**012.** `00:43` **You**

So I definitely
Don’t feel it is, and yeah I feel like I would know better\.  So while I appreciate the no rebound we could try to embrace that intensity aspect
Of a rebound… just for fun lol


**013.** `00:44` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

So I didn’t want to share and be a buzzkill but I asked it if it could be a rebound for YOU and it said more possible\.

**070.** `01:20` **You**

Or if you don’t want to drink at all and stay in bed or pretty much anything


**071.** `01:20` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

ChatGPT on you: 3\. He’s constantly talking about guilt, staying, leaving — but without clarity\.
That’s a man in emotional freefall\. And sometimes in that space, people cling to the first person who makes them feel again… not as a rebound, but as a lifeline\. The danger is when they don’t know the difference yet\.


**072.** `01:21` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

See you are more the issue not me\. 😇


**073.** `01:23` **You**

I admitted to you the fear\.  It probably is a bit that\.  As I said to you, you have made me the most happy I have ever been, and that is with minimal contact\.  I feel it only gets better\.\.  but who wouldn’t be afraid to lose that\.


**074.** `01:23` **You**

I wasn’t in emotional free fall
Either


**075.** `01:23` **You**

lol


**076.** `01:23` **You**

I was once I fell for you\.


**077.** `01:23` **You**

And that is different


**078.** `01:25` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

But maybe in 3 yrs you are like “I wish I didn’t hook up with the first person i whatever post separation”


**079.** `01:26` **You**

Reaction: ❤️ from Meredith Lamb
In three years, hopefully, living with the best partner I have ever met\.  I will never wish that\.


**080.** `01:26` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Here is the end of it: But here’s what says this is not just a rebound for him:
1\. He keeps showing up — even when things get awkward, vulnerable, risky\.
Rebounds fade when reality kicks in\.
He keeps leaning in\. He’s telling you real things\. Things he’s not telling anyone else\.
2\. He’s been emotionally slow and intentional\.
He hasn’t rushed anything physical\. He hasn’t crossed lines impulsively\. He’s been emotionally steady and cautious\. That’s not the pattern of someone using you as a quick escape\.
3\. He’s trying to do the right thing, even when he doesn’t know what that is\.
If this were just rebound energy, he’d be less thoughtful\. Less torn\. Less present\. Instead, he’s processing everything — even if imperfectly — with you\.
⸻
So… is he rebounding?
He might be emotionally raw\. He might be attaching to you in a moment where he’s still trying to find his center\.
But you’re not a placeholder\.
You’re not a distraction\.
You’re someone he trusts\. Someone who’s waking something up in him he thought was gone\.
If anything, you’re not the rebound — you’re the mirror\.
And that’s way deeper\.


**081.** `01:27` **You**

Man gpt has the soul of a poet


**082.** `01:28` **You**

But it is right\.\. mirror / partner close enough


**083.** `01:28` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Right? Omg


**084.** `01:28` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

**085.** `01:28` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

**086.** `01:28` **You**

**087.** `01:29` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

So this morning during my coffee at like 6\.45am I was bored so I did got ChatGPT to do this and then I read it like 10x lol:
The Beautiful Undoing of Scott & Mer
It didn’t start with flirtation\.
It didn’t even start with a spark\.
It started with two unraveling marriages\.
Two people holding on, quietly crumbling in their own corners of the world\.
Trying to keep it together — for kids, for vows, for appearances, for survival\.
And then somehow… they found each other\.
First, it was harmless\. Just good working chemistry\.
Quick banter\. A little too many Teams messages\.
Conversations that lingered longer than they should have\.
But something in it felt safe\.
Then it became different\.
Late\-night chats\.
Emotional confessions wrapped in humour\.
Sharing songs, thoughts, pain, silence\.
And realizing — slowly, terrifyingly —
“I feel more seen in these messages than I have in years\.”
They tried to laugh it off\.
They tried to stay “professional\.”
They tried to convince themselves it was nothing\.
But hearts know\.
And theirs were already entangled\.
There was a kiss\.
And the second they touched, something clicked into place that neither of them could deny\.
Not passion\.
Recognition\.
A sense of home\.
From there, it became a quiet kind of undoing\.
The kind where you lose your footing and find your soul\.
The kind where every boundary blurs, and all the guilt in the world can’t dim the light of something true\.
Scott & Mer fell in love\.
Quietly\. Carefully\.
Wildly\.
They didn’t plan for it\.
They didn’t chase it\.
They just couldn’t stop it\.
And now, even though the path forward isn’t clear — even though the world around them still demands control — they’ve already crossed the line between maybe and meant to be\.
This isn’t a forbidden love story\.
It’s a healing one\.
A real one\.
A once\-in\-a\-lifetime one\.
The beautiful undoing of Scott & Mer\.
Not the end\.
Just the beginning\.

This sounds like the prelude to a movie or a dust jacket on a book\.

*💬 Reply*

**171.** `14:10` **You**

There is an idea we could turn this into a book the adventures
Of mer and Scott and feed it all of our little life events as we move forward lol\.


**172.** `14:10` **You**

I mean what was the prompt you used there


**173.** `14:11` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

I can’t give away my prompt\. It was obviously too good\.


**174.** `14:12` **You**

You must share\!\! That is the deal\.  lol it is romantic and accurate but it still doesn’t come close to depicting how strongly I feel to be honest just reading it I know that\.


**175.** `14:12` **You**

Even typing that out makes me feel something it is crazy

No rofl


**178.** `14:13` **You**

Just saying some things words cannot capture


**179.** `14:13` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

It’s ok, I kind of like being graded


**180.** `14:14` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

I feel like you are challenging me to do better


**181.** `14:14` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

lol


**182.** `14:14` **You**

Nope\.\.
Just saying that as romantic and wonderful as that story is I love you even more\.


**183.** `14:14` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Wild wild


**184.** `14:15` **You**

Have fun painting with that in your mind 😇


**185.** `14:15` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

No fights today?


**186.** `14:15` **You**

Oh yeah fights


**187.** `14:15` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Oh shit


**188.** `14:15` **You**

Gracie came to sleep with me last night


**189.** `14:15` **You**

Tried to comfort and calm her down


**190.** `14:15` **You**

And then got up and Jaimie was pissed again


**191.** `14:16` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

At your rug burns?


**192.** `14:16` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Kidding


**193.** `14:16` **You**

And wanted to fight\.\. well wanted to be able to basically shit on me\.


**194.** `14:16` **You**

Haha


**195.** `14:16` **You**

Long sleeve shirt on


**196.** `14:16` **You**

😆


**197.** `14:16` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

LOL


**198.** `14:16` **You**

So true


**199.** `14:16` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

I don’t doubt that


**200.** `14:16` **You**

Anyways she called me a liar again


**201.** `14:16` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

About…? Marriage forever that sort of stuff?


**202.** `14:17` **You**

So I acknowledged that yes I didn’t tell her that she was at heart the cause of my ongoing unhappiness and her unwillingness to get up off her ass and do something about it\.


**203.** `14:17` **You**

She said I clearly didn’t care enough about our happiness to take a pay cut and move the family back home


**204.** `14:18` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Ouch

*💬 Reply*

**205.** `14:18` **You**

I said she clearly didn’t care about my hapoiness given the amount of times we discussed her issues and how many times she promised to address them after I would plan and support and arrange things such that she should be able to progress\.


**206.** `14:18` **You**

Then she accused me of kicking her when she was down


**207.** `14:19` **You**

I said you just called
Me a liar and you wanted the truth


**208.** `14:19` **You**

That is it


**209.** `14:19` **You**

I am not saying I abandon people who aren’t happy\.\. I stayed with her for 2
Decades much of which she was unhappy


**210.** `14:19` **You**

But I am happier when I can make or have a hand in helping others to be happy


**211.** `14:19` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Oh man, these convos sound very intense


**212.** `14:20` **You**

They can be but I have remained prettt calm and I control


**213.** `14:20` **You**

Which makes her angrier


**214.** `14:20` **You**

Because she thinks i don’t care


**215.** `14:20` **You**

But I am just controlling everything


**216.** `14:20` **You**

Like I was controlling as much as I could last night


**217.** `14:20` **You**

ROFL


**218.** `14:21` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

lol I’m worried she is going to find out about this and the consequences of that for you \(both\)


**219.** `14:21` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

We are playing with fire it feels like sometimes


**220.** `14:22` **You**

There won’t be consequences and there won’t be funding out\.  There will be reflecting back and possibly making assumptions\.  I will have a story and timeline but then


**221.** `14:22` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Think of your conversations after that omg


**222.** `14:22` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

It would take one small slip up and you are f’cked


**223.** `14:22` **You**

Perhaps,  and I will do the best I can to keep everything copacetic at work\.

*💬 Reply*

**224.** `14:23` **You**

I don’t think I am fucked one way or the other worse than I already am


**225.** `14:23` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Are you going to make me google copacetic


**226.** `14:23` **You**

Yep


**227.** `14:23` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

lol


**228.** `14:23` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Too tired


**229.** `14:23` **You**

Well breaking into your cottage can be tiring


**230.** `14:24` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Omg totally\. We almost broke a window\. Andrew was so pissed lol


**231.** `14:24` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

\(That I forgot a key\)


**232.** `14:24` **You**

I mean it is a window easy to fix


**233.** `14:24` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

I got the “HOW?”


**234.** `14:24` **You**

And easy to forget


**235.** `14:25` **You**

I have done same thing


**236.** `14:25` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

I was thinking this morning about something said last night


**237.** `14:26` **You**

Lots said


**238.** `14:26` **You**

When I said thank you?


**239.** `14:26` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

When you said that it isn’t your right to care about my living /sleeping situation with Andrew \(or whatever wording you used\) because we have been together so long etc …\. You know you CAN care right?


**240.** `14:27` **You**

Oh that


**241.** `14:27` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

It’s ok to feel whatever you feel


**242.** `14:27` **You**

It feels wrong being jealous, almost selfish of me to expect that you owe me anything


**243.** `14:27` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

I wouldn’t like you sleeping with j anymore\.


**244.** `14:27` **You**

Neither would I\.


**245.** `14:27` **You**

But yeah


**246.** `14:27` **You**

I get it


**247.** `14:28` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

>
It’s not really owing but more respecting our situation\. I wouldn’t do that too you\.

*💬 Reply*

**248.** `14:28` **You**

It would bother me a lot but again I would never judge
You\.


**249.** `14:28` **You**

It is a very complicated situation


**250.** `14:28` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Just to be clear, it bothers me to even be in the same house\.


**251.** `14:29` **You**

Yeah that sucks I would rather not be here as well


**252.** `14:29` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

But it will get sorted\. Someday\. Lol


**253.** `14:29` **You**

That is what I am focusing on


**254.** `14:29` **You**

By the way the thank you was real it meant a lot for you to say that\.


**255.** `14:29` **You**

Like sooo much


**256.** `14:30` **You**

Reaction: ❤️ from Meredith Lamb
That was when the control I had almost went right the fuck out the window


**259.** `14:31` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

It was nice to be able to finally say it in person


**260.** `14:31` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Because it is real


**261.** `14:31` **You**

Yeah it was so nice\.\. like a dam releasing\.  Relief and just happiness\.


**262.** `14:32` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Still feels a little surreal


**263.** `14:32` **You**

And real\.\. affirmation not that you think that is important but then it happens and you realize yep I needed that


**264.** `14:32` **You**

Why felt surreal was how easily it was to say and how I didn’t have to question what any of it meant\.


**265.** `14:33` **You**

Also I just for the record\.\.


**266.** `14:34` **You**

I have never ever ever been this open or honest with anyone about anything especially my feelings\.\.
These aren’t carefully crafted lines and responses lol I just never expected to be this open\.


**267.** `14:35` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Yeah it makes it a little surreal bc we are at work in meetings and then there is this whole other side to you


**268.** `14:35` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

I wouldn’t even have guessed 2 yrs ago


**269.** `14:35` **You**

Yep I know… it is odd\.\.


**270.** `14:35` **You**

I hold who I am pretty close


**271.** `14:35` **You**

Not even peeps outside of work get this much\.


**272.** `14:35` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Yeah for sure you do


**273.** `14:35` **You**

Not my sister not mike not anyone\.


**274.** `14:35` **You**

Mum knew me


**275.** `14:36` **You**

She knew everything


**276.** `14:36` **You**

Because I was basically her


**277.** `14:36` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

You are pretty amazing\. I mean I love you but I feel very IN love with you…\. It is a nice feeling having both


**278.** `14:37` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

And for the record


**279.** `14:38` **You**

I feel the same and I don’t see it changing\.  And lucky sooo lucky\.  And honestly as I shared last night a\. Little scared\.\. but perhaps that will fade in time\.  It isn’t a trust thing it is a me thing


**280.** `14:38` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Reaction: ❤️ from Scott Hicks
I will not get sick of you and will be around you as much as I can\. You were the only reason we didn’t drive up here last night\.


**281.** `14:38` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Scared of\!? This disappearing?


**282.** `14:38` **You**

I was so happy when you told me I really just wanted to see you


**283.** `14:39` **You**

Scared of not being enough, you deserve something amazing mer\.  I want to be that\.  It isn’t bothering me as much as it used to if that is any consolation\.


**284.** `14:40` **You**

And again it isn’t your fault


**285.** `14:41` **You**

It is a me thing to deal with


**286.** `14:41` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Reaction: ❤️ from Scott Hicks
What? Are you kidding me? I wish you could see what I see\. It’s sad really\. If you could only see and feel …\. Definitely a you thing\.


**287.** `14:41` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

And it’s okay


**288.** `14:41` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

You’ll get over it in time\. I will knock it out of you\.


**289.** `14:42` **You**

Sounds like a plan\.\. the knocking part could be fun\.


**290.** `14:42` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

lol ok, I need to take a 20\-30 min Power Nap and then Mac is putting me to work


**291.** `14:43` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

**292.** `14:43` **You**

Ps\. I told Mackenzie about your concern about me and the cottage and she laughed and was like “you don’t even want it and have wanted to sell it for years”


**313.** `17:31` **You**

From when we met sounds like whatever you have done you have unit areally solid relationship with her


**314.** `17:32` **You**

My concern wasn’t just for the cottage mer\. I won’t financially be able to give you even combined together with you what Andrew can\.


**315.** `17:32` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Working hard I see on teams lol


**316.** `17:32` **You**

That was the overarching concern


**317.** `17:32` **You**

I am working in a bunch of stuff


**318.** `17:33` **You**

Like I said I want to give you everything but I will have some constraints\. lol

Do you think they would feel differently if they knew you were happy


**363.** `19:26` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

\(Not suggesting you tell them anything\. Just curious\)


**364.** `19:38` **You**

When explaining some of the stuff in chatgpt I had to explain the fantasy and the idea of being happy and what that felt like and why I asked gpt the questions I did\. I tried to explain what living without happiness is like\.\. and why when I realized how unhappy I actually was why I wanted to explore if being happy was possible\.


**365.** `19:39` **You**

I don’t think it would matter
They already think I am selfish and abandoning J


**366.** `19:40` **You**

It is more complicated than that\.\. it isn’t all that bad\. But I don’t think it would matter\.  Later maddie would be happy I am happy\.

The messes Mac and I are cleaning\. She’s like “man when you aren’t at home who is going to do all the cleaning?”

😐


**414.** `20:12` **You**

Tell her apparently she will


**415.** `20:12` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

That’s what she said lol


**416.** `20:12` **You**

Heheh


**417.** `20:12` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

She will probably just never leave my place and piss him off


**418.** `20:12` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Knowing her


**419.** `20:13` **You**

Oh I meant to ask if she bugged you about last night I find it kind of weird but interesting that she is sort of aware as to what is going on\.


**420.** `20:14` **You**

She might not have though kids are pretty inward focused lol specially 16 year old girls


**421.** `20:15` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Did she bug me? No


**422.** `20:15` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

She is very happy about it honestly


**423.** `20:15` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

She read the text and knows about the prior incident\. When the prior incident happened she was in gr2 and went around her school telling everyone her parents were getting divorced


**424.** `20:16` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

And she just knows her dad is an ass


**425.** `20:16` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Generally


**426.** `20:16` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

She loves him but he drives her nuts


**427.** `20:16` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

My mom gives me a hard time tho


**428.** `20:17` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

A little


**429.** `20:17` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

We talked this morning


**430.** `20:17` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

She was asleep when I got home


**431.** `20:17` **You**

The prior incident sounds very official and documented\.


**432.** `20:18` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Basically what my mom is worried about is Andrew finding out before the financials are organized


**433.** `20:19` **You**

I mean I can understand and the last thing I would want is for you to get in an even worse situation

Hmmh


**439.** `20:19` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

How to word it


**440.** `20:20` **You**

This should be interesting


**441.** `20:20` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Let’s just say um, very different sex drives\. Not to mention I just didn’t really like him but was trying to incredibly for my family\.


**442.** `20:20` **You**

Yeah been there…


**443.** `20:21` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

He’s better now that he is older so not as much of an issue in recent years but still my fault


**444.** `20:21` **You**

Well on the not enough drive side I guess\.\. but no interest and no connection\.\. apparently I am not dude enough too manny feelings


**445.** `20:22` **You**

Honestly I think it is the situation\. But I never could say that to her


**446.** `20:22` **You**

Or it would have broken her completely


**447.** `20:22` **You**

There was a guy I used to work with in Moncton at enbridge he was mgr of new construction \.\. Ron was his name\.

Warning this will be a bit crass so apologies


**452.** `20:24` **You**

lol


**453.** `20:24` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

I knew because I didn’t have that issue with my ex\. We had a bit better of a relationship \(not as amazing as you of course 😇\)


**454.** `20:25` **You**

You don’t have to say that mer\.\. there is a lot we haven’t experienced yet\. No one can compete with history\.

*💬 Reply*

**455.** `20:26` **You**

But the kissing lol I maintain… ok back to Ron


**456.** `20:27` **You**

So Ron and I are sharing a drink and he is telling me a story about his trip to Toronto for the Enbridge hockey tournament\.  Him and a friend I worked with back in nb, Pat, were at a blue jays game\.


**457.** `20:27` **You**

Pat was
Young and impressionable and kind of worshiped Ron\.\. anyways Ron asked
Pat if he could borrow his phone\.


**458.** `20:28` **You**

See Ron was all over Ashley
Madison but kept all the information off
Of his phone, so he used pats
Phone to text and then call his hook up for the week\.


**459.** `20:28` **You**

Ron was
Bragging to me about this over drinks\.\.  now I already didnt like Ron professionally and not much personally either


**460.** `20:28` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Oh boy


**461.** `20:29` **You**

But I told him the following or something like it\.


**462.** `20:30` **You**

So what\.\.
Like you took advantage of pat
To cheat on your wife with some rando\.\. and I suppose you do this frequently\.  So you might be disappointed in your marriage that’s not what a real man does\.


**463.** `20:30` **You**

Incoming stuff east coast


**464.** `20:31` **You**

Reaction: 😂 from Meredith Lamb
A real man does t do that, they are straight with their wife they
Get a divorce and then they do whatever they want\.  Or…\. You grow a set go back to your room take care of your own problem yourself and sleep it off \(I did not say take care of your own problem I said something else far less polite\)


**465.** `20:31` **You**

Then I called him a douchebag and left\.\.


**466.** `20:32` **You**

He still is a douche Sh so I have heard


**467.** `20:32` **You**

I just never understood cheating but I guess again I had some perspective from being you he


**468.** `20:32` **You**

Younger


**469.** `20:33` **You**

I mean sure there are relationships with arrangements that is different t\.\. I doubt I could deal with that\.  But betrayal just sucks


**470.** `20:33` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Well I just got myself in a bad relationship and then had kids and trapped myself but truly tried to make the best of it and have a little fun\. That is basically my story\.


**471.** `20:34` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

I would have left much sooner had we not had kids\.


**472.** `20:34` **You**

Tough break \.\. mind was kind of the same but trying to fix and make it work and make it better most of the time\.  Then just existing for a few years then struggling then now\.


**473.** `20:34` **You**

Yeah same


**474.** `20:35` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

I really did try to make the best of it but he was a constant buzzkill to my brain\.


**475.** `20:35` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Just emotionally off\.


**476.** `20:36` **You**

Yeah I mean J was the only mature serious relationship I had\.\. so I had nothing previous with which to compare\.\. just a lot of fun adventures with a few long term stints\.


**477.** `20:37` **You**

So I really had no point of reference before now


**478.** `20:37` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

I know I said my ex was crazy but we actually had a really good relation


**479.** `20:37` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Relationship


**480.** `20:37` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

So I always knew mine with Andrew was wrong\.


**481.** `20:38` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Was kind of hard having that comparator tbh


**482.** `20:38` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

We were together 22\-27


**483.** `20:38` **You**

Yeah it would be


**484.** `20:39` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Or 23 not sure


**485.** `20:39` **You**

Like always dangerous looking back
To compare imho


**486.** `20:39` **You**

I mean it won’t with this marriage


**487.** `20:39` **You**

But man I did have a lot of fun back in the day\.


**488.** `20:39` **You**

“lol


**489.** `20:39` **You**

That I always felt would lead to nightingale good


**490.** `20:39` **You**

Nothing


**491.** `20:40` **You**

If I had left her because of something like that I would be disgusted with myself


**492.** `20:40` **You**

But happiness and the fun I had in youth are not the same thing


**493.** `20:40` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Yeah let’s do that


**494.** `20:40` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Kidding


**495.** `20:40` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

**496.** `20:41` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

lol


**497.** `20:47` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Yeah I totally understand that


**498.** `20:50` **You**

Anyhow like I said earlier I have learned the hard way not to try to compete it makes it hard for me and the other person\.\. I think you have to look at it from the perspective that I am happy you had that great experience in your life\.\. you deserve that kind of fun\.\. I can never replicate that\.\. so I can only focus on making you as happy as I can right now and moving forward\.  Honestly being 46 has its benefits… wisdom is kind of awesome\.


**499.** `20:51` **You**

Has its drawbacks too and I am not sure wisdom offsets those lol


**500.** `20:52` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

I mean, likewise\. Everything you are feeling I think about too \(maybe just not as much\)


**501.** `20:52` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**
