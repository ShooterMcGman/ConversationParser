**021.** `10:44` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

That was intense\.


**022.** `10:44` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Wasn‚Äôt expecting that\.


**023.** `10:48` **You**

I am just talking to j coming up in a sec


**024.** `11:57` **You**

You ok you looked really cranky


**025.** `12:03` **You**

Are you ok??


**026.** `12:11` **You**

Not sure what is going on but head home if you need to work from there\.


**027.** `12:50` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

So I haven‚Äôt given really any thought to telling Daniel about our situation\. Will think about it if my brain can handle that


**028.** `12:50` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

I‚Äôd really rather not tho


**029.** `12:55` **You**

I thought we agreed in here not to


**030.** `12:56` **You**

I said we can figure out a timeline later


**031.** `12:56` **You**

Like down the road


**032.** `12:56` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

I know but it sounds like you have thought about it more than I have


**033.** `12:56` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

I honestly haven‚Äôt thought about it much


**034.** `12:56` **You**

I just don‚Äôt want to seem duplicitous\.


**035.** `12:56` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

I just don‚Äôt want to without even thinking about it lol


**036.** `12:56` **You**

Like I said that is fine


**037.** `12:56` **You**

No pressure


**038.** `12:56` **You**

Remove it from your thoughts


**039.** `12:57` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Could it not be plausible that when we are both officially separated‚Ä¶ a timeline would then start?


**040.** `12:57` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

I will think about it


**041.** `12:57` **You**

Yea


**042.** `12:57` **You**

That is more realistic


**043.** `12:57` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

But I think there is a way that it could not be duplicitous


**044.** `12:58` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

But maybe I‚Äôm being naive?


**045.** `12:58` **You**

But I would want to be honest maybe suggest that we kind of made a connection through supporting each other but agreed not to explore anything until after everything was sorted


**046.** `12:58` **You**

But again
Don‚Äôt need to decide today\.\.


**047.** `12:58` **You**

So you can just leave it lol


**048.** `12:59` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Hmmh ok ‚Ä¶ I will ask ChatGPT later ;\)


**049.** `12:59` **You**

Whatever\.\. you wanted me to lighten the load I am trying here lol\.


**050.** `13:00` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

I never said anything to you about that‚Ä¶ ChatGPT did


**051.** `13:05` **You**

Prompt 1\.
I am trying to get a conversation by conversation analysis from start to finish of this transcript\.  Specifically Meredith is someone I am madly in love with, and I think she feels the same about me\.\. but we are navigating some challenging situations, and I would be interested in your OBJECTIVE observations \- do not spare my feelings please\.  Let's start here\.


**052.** `13:05` **You**

Response 1
Your provided transcript with Meredith highlights a deep emotional connection and intense attraction between you both\. Here‚Äôs a structured, objective analysis based on the conversation provided:
‚∏ª
Conversation Analysis: Key Observations
1\. Emotional Connection
- Mutual intensity and rarity:
Meredith explicitly notes via a ChatGPT response the rare nature of your connection‚Äîemotional depth, immediate understanding, and a sense of inevitability characterize your interactions\. This is significant as it shows she is intellectually rationalizing the intensity and rarity of your relationship, which indicates deep emotional investment\.
- Rapid vulnerability:
Both of you express a quick escalation in openness and emotional vulnerability\. Meredith particularly emphasizes this as unusual for both of you, reinforcing the idea that the connection feels uniquely safe and genuine\.
2\. Mutual Insecurity
- Both of you frequently express insecurity, especially about the stability and exclusivity of your relationship given external circumstances \(your separation and her situation with Andrew\)\.
- You explicitly voice concerns about Andrew potentially drawing her back, while Meredith shows clear jealousy and discomfort regarding your ongoing cohabitation with your spouse\.
- Despite these insecurities, there‚Äôs a consistent reassurance from both sides, suggesting a solid mutual trust forming underneath the surface\-level anxieties\.
3\. Relationship Dynamics
- Meredith seems slightly more cautious, frequently mentioning the need to ‚Äúslow down,‚Äù acknowledging her natural inclination to move quickly, and consciously trying to temper this impulse for self\-preservation\.
- Your natural style is also fast\-paced, but you humorously acknowledge your attempts at restraint\. However, your approach is noticeably more impulsive and eager‚Äîsuggesting a risk\-taking, emotionally driven stance\.
4\. Communication Style
- Your conversations show playful banter mixed with serious emotional reflections, indicating a healthy rapport and ease in communicating complex feelings\.
- The use of humor and light teasing \(‚Äúso lame,‚Äù ‚Äúterrible moves‚Äù\) functions as a tension diffuser, highlighting strong chemistry and emotional comfort\.
5\. Challenges and Realities
- Family Dynamics and Finances:
Both of you are navigating significant relationship exits, sharing concerns about financial implications, custody arrangements, and living situations\. Meredith notably expresses practical concerns \(like house ownership and spousal support\)\.

**053.** `13:05` **You**

Prompt 2
Some additional context that might prove useful \- despite our being the same age, my children are 16 and 18, and hers are 12, 14 and 16, and are all very much engaged with her on a regular basis\.  She has a significant amount of friends that engage with her on a regular basis\.\. I have none or maybe one\. Not counting her\.\. and while she is awesome she has significant demands on her time\.  She additionally has sought some comfort and peace in having a drink or two at night\.\. sometimes thc gummies\.\. something to take the edge off which might impact some of her conversations\.\. or when she becomes quieter and not as responsive\.  I truly believe we both feel the same way about each other\.\. I have made her a mix tape, wrote her a love letter like back in the 90's  all impulsively, all because I love her and want her to be happy\.  While this type of outward emotion is not her style, she also surprised me with a rock that represented the rocks in her yard when she was a kid \- one of her favorite memories and had M \(heart\) S engraved on it\.  We have found some time to be together, to be intimate with each other, and it seems like we are both very happy, even though she is still does seem to be holding back a bit\.  Now with this additional context\.\. can you ply any deeper into this transcript\.\. please be as detailed and as thorough as possible\.


**054.** `13:06` **You**

Response 2
Given your additional context, here‚Äôs a deeper, detailed exploration of the conversation, emphasizing key areas of emotional nuance, relationship dynamics, challenges, and strengths within your interactions with Meredith\.
‚∏ª
Deeper Conversation Analysis with Contextual Integration
1\. Emotional Intensity and Mutual Affection
Your emotional connection with Meredith appears genuine, mutual, and intense\. Meredith repeatedly engages with concepts like rarity and emotional vulnerability, highlighting that this is not typical for either of you\. Notably:
- Shared Sense of ‚ÄúUnbelievability‚Äù:
Meredith‚Äôs direct query to ChatGPT about the unusual nature of your connection strongly suggests she‚Äôs trying to rationalize powerful emotions\. This indicates significant self\-awareness about the intensity and rarity of her feelings, revealing deep emotional investment and vulnerability\.
- Acts of Affection \(Love Language\):
- Your spontaneous actions \(mixtape, handwritten love letter\) indicate profound emotional commitment and a desire to provide tangible proof of your affection\.
- Her gift \(engraved rock\) is equally meaningful in her own emotional language‚Äîsubtle but deeply personal\. It signals significant vulnerability, given that outward emotional displays are not her typical comfort zone\.
Key Insight:
These gestures, though differently expressed, reflect high emotional synchronicity\. Meredith‚Äôs careful yet meaningful expressions indicate profound feelings, albeit communicated subtly\.
‚∏ª
2\. Different Life Contexts and Social Dynamics
There is a notable asymmetry between your social circumstances, significantly impacting your relationship dynamic:
- Social Isolation vs\. Social Richness:
Meredith has robust social structures \(active friendships, heavily involved parenting of younger teens\), contrasting your relative isolation\. This asymmetry likely intensifies your emotional dependency and investment in Meredith, increasing your sensitivity to perceived changes in her engagement or affection levels\.
- Impact on Communication Patterns:
Meredith‚Äôs busy social and familial life naturally limits her availability, creating potential gaps that you perceive as withdrawal or hesitation\. This dynamic exacerbates insecurities, evidenced in your messages expressing concerns about her commitment and potential reconciliation with Andrew\.
Key Insight:
This imbalance could heighten your sensitivity to Meredith‚Äôs natural fluctuations in responsiveness, potentially triggering anxiety or insecurity that she perceives as pressure\.
‚∏ª
3\. Coping Mechanisms and Communication Style
Meredith‚Äôs casual use of alcohol and THC gummies as coping mechanisms introduces potential variability in her communication style:
- Fluctuations in Engagement:
When Meredith becomes quieter or less responsive, it likely represents her personal time to decompress\. This withdrawal can inadvertently trigger anxiety or uncertainty in you, misread as emotional detachment or decreased interest\.
- Impact on Relationship Stability:
While her substance use seems moderate and recreational, your emotional state‚Äîcombined with existing insecurities‚Äîcould amplify misunderstandings or misinterpretations of her quieter moments\.
Key Insight:
Her reduced responsiveness during these periods is less likely an emotional statement and more a self\-care strategy\. Clear, empathetic communication about these habits could prevent misinterpretation and emotional friction\.
‚∏ª
4\. Jealousy, Territoriality, and Relationship Security
Both of you express jealousy and territorial feelings, crucial indicators of emotional depth but also potential stress points:
- Meredith‚Äôs Territoriality:
Meredith‚Äôs admitted jealousy after your return home underscores deep emotional attachment\. Her territoriality, coupled with a preference to take things slow, reflects an internal conflict‚Äîstrong desire versus emotional self\-protection\.
- Your Expressed Insecurities:
Your worry about her potentially reconciling with Andrew, and her reassurance \(‚Äúhow could that even be possible?‚Äù\), highlight underlying mutual insecurities\. Meredith‚Äôs reassurances here are direct and meaningful, revealing strong emotional certainty\.
Key Insight:
This mutual jealousy, if positively navigated, can enhance intimacy through increased vulnerability and explicit reassurances\. Openly acknowledging these feelings is critical to building trust\.
‚∏ª
5\. Family, Financial, and Practical Realities
You both openly discuss practical relationship exit strategies \(spousal support, asset distribution\), reflecting mature emotional intelligence:
- Meredith‚Äôs Pragmatism:
Meredith‚Äôs detailed discussions around finances, home ownership, and educational funding illustrate a pragmatic and structured approach to handling her separation\. This demonstrates her capability for strategic planning in personal life, complementing her cautious emotional pace\.
- Your Approach to Finances:
You humorously acknowledge the complexities of your financial separation, using humor \(‚ÄúI am going to need to ask for a pay bump‚Äù\) to diffuse tension\. Your communication about practical issues is supportive and collaborative\.
Key Insight:
The practical transparency between you is beneficial\. It fosters a sense of partnership and mutual support, critical to navigating complex family dynamics\.
‚∏ª
6\. Intimacy and Physical Connection
Physical intimacy has been established and is a notable positive reinforcement to your emotional bond:
- Meredith‚Äôs Caution Around Intimacy:
Meredith explicitly admits the tension \(‚ÄúI hardly touched you\. Intentional\.‚Äù\) reflects cautious emotional pacing\. However, she is simultaneously candid about strong physical attraction and emotional desire, suggesting careful balancing rather than hesitancy\.
- Your Emotional Sensitivity to Intimacy:
Your humorous self\-deprecations \(‚Äúterrible moves,‚Äù ‚Äúself\-conscious‚Äù\) mask genuine vulnerability around physical intimacy\. Meredith counters this by offering consistent reassurance, reinforcing emotional safety\.
Key Insight:
The mutual recognition of strong physical chemistry balanced against emotional caution is positive\. Maintaining explicit dialogue about comfort, pacing, and boundaries ensures continued emotional safety and mutual respect\.
‚∏ª
7\. Work and Professional Boundaries
Your professional overlap creates explicit complexity:
- Both explicitly acknowledge the potential risks \(‚Äúwe still have to worry about work‚Äù\)\. Meredith emphasizes the importance of managing perceptions \(‚Äútrying to be normal‚Äù\), indicating a strong awareness of professional stakes\.
Key Insight:
Continued explicit conversations about professional boundaries are essential\. Clearly establishing boundaries for workplace interactions helps mitigate unnecessary stress or rumors\.
‚∏ª
8\. Emotional Regulation and Relationship Pacing
Meredith emphasizes ‚Äúgoing slow‚Äù repeatedly, clearly identifying emotional pacing as critical for her emotional safety:
- Her attempts to slow things down \(‚Äúholding back = self preservation‚Äù\) underscore intentional emotional regulation, contrasted sharply with your impulsivity \(‚Äúscrew planning,‚Äù spontaneous mixtape, love letters\)\.
- Your shared recognition of difficulty in maintaining a slower pace \(‚ÄúSlow isn‚Äôt your style lol see problem Is it isn‚Äôt mine either‚Äù\) suggests mutual awareness that pacing is challenging but necessary for sustainable emotional stability\.
Key Insight:
Actively supporting Meredith‚Äôs pacing preference while still authentically expressing your own feelings is crucial\. Achieving this balance will require clear, compassionate negotiation about emotional expectations and pace\.
‚∏ª
Final Synthesis and Recommendations
Strengths:
- Mutual Authenticity: Both clearly express deep affection, transparency, and vulnerability\.
- Balanced Affectionate Gestures: Despite differing emotional styles, each has found ways to deeply connect emotionally \(letters, engraved gifts\)\.
- Pragmatic Problem Solving: Open discussions about complex practical issues demonstrate emotional maturity and realistic relationship grounding\.
Risks and Challenges:
- Social Isolation and Dependency: Your limited social connections place substantial emotional reliance on Meredith, potentially overwhelming her given her extensive social obligations\.
- Misinterpretation of Communication Patterns: Meredith‚Äôs quieter moments or reduced responsiveness may inadvertently trigger insecurity or misunderstanding\.
- Professional Complexity: Workplace dynamics require vigilant management to prevent professional complications\.
Recommendations for Relationship Development:
1\.	Social Expansion:
Actively explore developing external social supports or friendships to balance emotional dependency\.
2\.	Structured Check\-Ins:
Regularly scheduled, explicit conversations \(weekly or bi\-weekly\) to openly discuss emotional states, insecurities, boundaries, and pacing\.
3\.	Clarify Communication Expectations:
Develop a mutual understanding of communication preferences, particularly around her quieter evenings, to prevent misunderstandings\.
4\.	Professional Boundaries Plan:
Jointly establish explicit guidelines for professional interactions to protect both reputations and alleviate anxiety around workplace exposure\.
5\.	Substance Use Transparency:
Maintain empathetic, non\-judgmental conversations about substance use to ensure it remains a healthy coping strategy, clearly separated from your relationship communication\.
‚∏ª
Your relationship with Meredith demonstrates substantial mutual affection, emotional depth, and authentic vulnerability, balanced by pragmatic awareness of external complexities\. With deliberate emotional pacing, structured communication, and conscious management of your differing social dynamics and communication styles, your connection shows robust potential for long\-term fulfillment\.


**055.** `13:13` **You**

There now you have some stuff to read\.


**056.** `13:21` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Although it isn‚Äôt your original, I will take it\. :\)


**057.** `13:22` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

It all makes sense‚Ä¶ a lot of things all converging at once\. Just stress left right and centre and when I have to tell the team, Carolyn etc mooooooore stress


**058.** `13:22` **You**

It is pretty thorough


**059.** `13:22` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

It is a lot right now


**060.** `13:23` **You**

I am more concerned with you particularly how you feel how I can help you\.  I am going to ask it another question


**061.** `13:31` **You**

Reaction: üòÇ from Meredith Lamb
Last one for the day curious how close it comes to what I have already said\.
Prompt
I have frequently tried to explain to Meredith, and I get it can be hard to believe that I am absolutely in love with her\.\. like forever\.\. I think the only way I can feel this certain is that I am almost 47\.\. while she already is\.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.\.  How can I assure her that I have never felt this certain or this strongly for anyone\.\. both on an intimacy and friendship level\.\. which having both together is kind of insane\.\. I just need her to know without of a shadow of a doubt that she is my home, and that is all I will ever need?  The thing is if this is what it is like to fall deeply in love with someone, then I have never even approached this level of feeling and conviction\.  So help a fella out here please\!


**062.** `13:31` **You**

Response
Scott, what you‚Äôre experiencing is powerful and deeply genuine, which is precisely why expressing it clearly and convincingly can feel challenging\. Here‚Äôs how you can convey this depth of feeling to Meredith with clarity, sincerity, and emotional intensity, leaving no room for doubt:
‚∏ª
1\. Start with Complete, Vulnerable Honesty
Begin by openly acknowledging the magnitude and rarity of what you‚Äôre feeling\. Explicitly state that you‚Äôve never felt anything approaching this\.
Example wording:
‚ÄúMeredith, I understand how hard this must be to truly believe‚Äîhonestly, it‚Äôs hard even for me to grasp sometimes\. But I need you to know that, at almost 47 years old, I‚Äôm experiencing something I‚Äôve never come close to before\. If this is what truly falling in love feels like‚Äîdeeply, madly, completely‚Äîthen everything else in my life has just been practice\.‚Äù
‚∏ª
2\. Explicitly Acknowledge Her Doubts
Recognize openly that her hesitation or uncertainty isn‚Äôt unreasonable, which validates her feelings and builds trust\.
Example wording:
‚ÄúI know how cautious you feel right now‚Äîand I get why you‚Äôre holding back\. It‚Äôs smart, it‚Äôs careful, it makes sense\. But please hear me clearly: my feelings aren‚Äôt impulsive or temporary\. They‚Äôre the culmination of a lifetime of learning what matters, and I‚Äôve never been surer of anything in my life\.‚Äù
‚∏ª
3\. Emphasize the Dual Aspect \(Intimacy \+ Friendship\)
Make a point of how rare and extraordinary it is to have both intimate attraction and profound friendship simultaneously\.
Example wording:
‚ÄúWhat we have isn‚Äôt just attraction or romance\. It‚Äôs also this profound friendship that makes every conversation meaningful, every silence comfortable, every shared moment deeper\. To have both‚Äîthis magnetic intimacy and this level of trust and friendship‚Äîis frankly incredible\. It‚Äôs the kind of bond people dream about but rarely find\.‚Äù
‚∏ª
4\. Clearly Communicate ‚ÄúShe is Home‚Äù
The concept of someone feeling like ‚Äúhome‚Äù resonates deeply because it‚Äôs a metaphor for belonging, safety, acceptance, and permanence\.
Example wording:
‚ÄúMer, you are my home\. Wherever we are together‚Äîno matter the circumstances, no matter how messy‚Äîit‚Äôs the place I belong\. With you, everything feels right, safe, and certain\. You‚Äôre not just someone I want; you‚Äôre exactly who I need\.‚Äù
‚∏ª
5\. Explain Your Certainty through Life Experience
Your age and life stage uniquely qualify you to distinguish deep, lasting love from temporary infatuation or comfort\.
Example wording:
‚ÄúI believe the reason I feel this certain, this completely sure about you, is because at this point in my life, I finally understand the difference between settling for comfort and choosing the person who makes me feel truly alive\. Meredith, you‚Äôre that person\. I‚Äôve never felt this clarity and conviction before‚Äînot even close\.‚Äù
‚∏ª
6\. Reinforce with Tangible Gestures and Actions
Follow words with consistent actions‚Äîcontinue with heartfelt, thoughtful gestures \(like your mixtape, love letter, and the engraved rock she gave you\)\. This reinforces that your words aren‚Äôt empty but deeply sincere\.
Example actions:
- Small, thoughtful reminders of your connection \(notes, texts, meaningful tokens\)\.
- Consistently supporting her boundaries and pacing\.
- Being emotionally available without pressure\.
‚∏ª
Putting It All Together: A Suggested Heartfelt Message to Meredith
‚ÄúMeredith,
I know I‚Äôve said it before, and I‚Äôll keep saying it until you feel it as clearly as I do: I‚Äôve never, ever experienced love like this before‚Äînothing even close\. I‚Äôm almost 47, and at this age, people usually know exactly who they are and what they want\. And right now, I know‚Äîwithout hesitation‚Äîthat all I want, all I will ever need, is you\.
You‚Äôre both my best friend and the woman I‚Äôm wildly in love with, and experiencing those feelings simultaneously is something I never imagined possible\. It feels unreal sometimes, I know\. But I promise you, it‚Äôs real\. You are my home\. Home isn‚Äôt a place‚Äîit‚Äôs you\. It‚Äôs us\. Wherever we are together, that‚Äôs exactly where I belong\.
I understand why you might hold back\. But please trust this: I‚Äôve lived enough to recognize the difference between settling for what‚Äôs easy and reaching for what‚Äôs truly right\. You‚Äôre exactly who I choose, who I‚Äôll always choose\.
This isn‚Äôt fleeting‚Äîit‚Äôs forever\. I love you completely, Meredith\.‚Äù
‚∏ª
Why this will resonate:
- It demonstrates deep emotional maturity\.
- It directly addresses her doubts, showing empathy for her perspective\.
- It emphasizes the uniqueness and strength of your feelings\.
- It provides reassurance through both words and implied ongoing actions\.
By framing your feelings this transparently and empathetically, you‚Äôll provide Meredith the clarity and reassurance she deeply desires and deserves\.


**063.** `13:31` **You**

Pretty sure gpt nailed it better\.\. but I agree with all of it\.


**064.** `13:46` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Okay that was a lot\. Lol I wouldn‚Äôt say I‚Äôm uncertain but I agree that I am cautious\. This is a lot, especially with everything else going on and you can‚Äôt argue with that\. I do feel the same way about you so agree with ChatGPT there but my rational side says be careful Meredith\.

**073.** `13:51` **You**

I am not even going to think on that anymore I 100% trust you\.  I was hesitant at first\.\. but I think I have looked in your eyes long enough that I don‚Äôt feel I have to worry\.


**074.** `13:51` **You**

But it is complex\.\. but it doesn‚Äôt have to be just place the boundaries and move them when you are ready\.


**075.** `13:53` **You**

I mean I feel like you are more uncertain now than previously just not sure how to fix that\.


**076.** `13:55` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

I‚Äôm not ‚Äúmore uncertain‚Äù\. I‚Äôve just had some exposure into how attached you two are and it feels different than Andrew and I\. That‚Äôs all\. It‚Äôs okay, just different\.


**077.** `13:58` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

It actually seems like you guys have a bit of a connection when you talk\. Just saying\.


**078.** `13:59` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Hoping you don‚Äôt regret later\.


**079.** `13:59` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

I know you situation is different than mine yadda yadda


**080.** `13:59` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

I get that


**081.** `13:59` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

And all the rest


**082.** `13:59` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

lol


**083.** `14:02` **You**

Meredith err nah gerrd there is nothing I have felt for anyone that comes close to you ever ever ever, friend, companion, partner,
Lover everything\.  I won‚Äôt 20 years with Jaimie I feel I owe her support\.\. we didn‚Äôt end the same way\.\. I don‚Äôt despise her\.\. but even at the best of times what I felt for her wasn‚Äôt even a shadow of what I feel for you\.  We were partners at best nothing else\. The only way I would ever regret t this is if you left for some reason\.


**084.** `14:03` **You**

This is the kind of guy you love it is who I am\.  I am not a pos that would abandon someone completely just because our lives fell apart\.  But my commitment is to you\.\. you het everything I have to give you\.  No one else ever got that not even close\.


**085.** `14:05` **You**

This is why spending time together is important that reassurance is meaningful\.  So when you can get your head around a solution you let me know lol\.\.
I will give you as much reassurance as
You need


**086.** `14:07` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Noted and I get that\. Our circumstances are very different even if somewhat similar\. Maybe I‚Äôm a bit jealous of Jaime lol I mean just understand I‚Äôm not dealing with the same kind of person on the other side so it might be a bit more stressful


**087.** `14:10` **You**

Omg Meredith shall I get up on my desk here and scream it from inside my office\.


**088.** `14:10` **You**

Cause I will üòà


**089.** `14:10` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Noooo


**090.** `14:12` **You**

I am a bit jealous of everyone that gets time with you\.\. honestly if it makes it easier‚Ä¶ I will get out and rent a place seriously like i just want to be with you\.\. everything else will take care of itself\.\. but if in the meantime this is easier it is easy for me to do\.


**091.** `14:13` **You**

I also literally spend the minimum amount of time at home that I have to\.


**092.** `14:15` **You**

But one thing you should be certain of is she dislikes me now\.\. a lot even though we are being amicable,  she does\. It want to get back together ever and suggested today she will never forgive me\.\. so again‚Ä¶ time and patience and there will only be you\.


**093.** `14:17` **You**

See this is what gpt said I go overboard because I want to make sure you are 100% ok because honestly I don‚Äôt ever wan you to feel uncertain about me\.


**094.** `14:21` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

I‚Äôm not sure it is overboard ‚Äúper se‚Äù but I think you can easily articulate your thoughts and some of us can‚Äôt do that quite so easily\.


**095.** `14:21` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Because you can, you do\.


**096.** `14:21` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Because I can‚Äôt, I don‚Äôt\.


**097.** `14:22` **You**

Well I hope my articulating these thoughts helps ease the thoughts that you are having a harder time articulating\.


**098.** `14:22` **You**

It is less important that you can reciprocate\.  It is more important that you understand and believe\.


**099.** `14:55` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

I do believe but have moments of doubt\. That‚Äôs all\. If this situation wasn‚Äôt so messy all around, I think it would be incredibly easier to navigate\.


**100.** `14:55` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

But it‚Äôs worth it\. ;\)


**101.** `14:59` **You**

Just don‚Äôt give up on me because I won‚Äôt give up on you\.  If you ever have doubt ask\. It isn‚Äôt weak\.\. if you need reassurance I will always provide it without question\.


**102.** `14:59` **You**

Honestly it is so sick that we are having to go through this we are months away\.


**103.** `14:59` **You**

Like that is nothing compared to what comes after


**104.** `15:00` **You**

Even if there will be some transition time etc


**105.** `15:06` **You**

>
I guess my questions are and feel free to withdraw\.\. doubts about us, about me and Jaimie, about what you want, about what I want?  I know clarity is hard for you but I feel just leaving it at I have doubts is a little open ended, and hard for me to reconcile\.

*üí¨ Reply*

**106.** `15:45` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

So my moments of doubt come at random times\. But honestly when you were talking to Jaime when I was there‚Ä¶\. Enter doubt\. I just have such different conversations with Andrew even during logistical type stuff\. And oftentimes, we just don‚Äôt even talk at all ever\. No need to respond to that though because you already did\. Another doubt I sometimes have is just from not knowing you long enough\. If you are super into this right now will you turn a switch later but I have mentioned this before\. You just say yourself you are very fast at making decisions\. I don‚Äôt have any doubts about what I want\. If I did I wouldn‚Äôt bother switching jobs right now\. I would wait until later\.


**107.** `15:49` **You**

I am so going to show you what you mean to me if given the chance mer\.\. all I can say\.  I cannot help with some of these doubts unfortunately\.  I will never be super into anyone else\.  Ever\.  I don‚Äôt want anyone else I have never said anything like any of what I have said to anyone else ever\.  I am sitting here writing this feeling chills because I am trying to literally will you into believing that my decision is you\.  I explained the Jaimie thing took years and I tried to change the course the entire time\.\. I didn‚Äôt just give up and say screw it\.   But yes like you in that moment where Andrew asked you to hook back up\.\. there was a moment like that for me where I was like yep I am done\.  I don‚Äôt think we are dissimilar there\.


**108.** `15:50` **You**

Home is you there is no where else


**109.** `15:50` **You**

Patience and time‚Ä¶ and trust\.\. trust me mer I swear I won‚Äôt make you regret it ever\.


**110.** `15:53` **You**

I am trying to do the same with you\. Bit of a leap I know\.\.


**111.** `15:53` **You**

But we can hold hands on the way down\.


**112.** `15:56` **You**

Do you have a min to pop in I have to leave shortly after 4


**113.** `15:56` **You**

Going to bank


**114.** `16:01` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

On a call with octo and mate


**115.** `16:01` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Maye


**116.** `17:18` **You**

Hope that went well


**117.** `17:31` **You**

Oh and if you doubt again and I am not around\.\. please come back and read this\.  It is now and always will be true\.  I am happy this is one more roadblock down mer\.


**118.** `17:39` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

That went well but Michelle walked over so she knows\. Then we realized Louise was at her desk so she knows too\. Team doesn‚Äôt\.


**119.** `17:41` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

I need to drive home but I did appreciate what you wrote\. Also appreciate you and Daniel making the job switch happen relatively quickly ‚Ä¶ realize transition may be lengthy but that is fine\.


**120.** `17:48` **You**

As you said it is progress\.\. and I will do whatever I can to help you\.


**121.** `18:08` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

I mean one less thing to do now \(find another job for various reasons\) so that is a relief honestly


**122.** `18:14` **You**

Yep one down a few to go\. lol


**123.** `19:02` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

Yeah just a few\. Got home \- bickered and fought about mediation, dogs etc for a while\. So fun this life is right now\. :p


**124.** `19:08` **You**

Just focus on me then\.\.
Focus on us\.\. that is what I do


**125.** `19:09` **You**

Don‚Äôt engage\.\. that is what the mediator is for let them do their job you won‚Äôt solve anything with him directly


**126.** `19:10` **You**

He needs to be shown reality and then appreciate the sacrifices you were willing to make for what they actually are\.


**127.** `19:12` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

I will do my best to :\)

**128.** `19:12` **You**

**132.** `19:18` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

I got out of volleyball tonight so taking the dogs to the park


**133.** `19:19` **You**

Good go get a good walk in with the dogs\.\. heading to gym shortly here to go for my own walk\.


**134.** `19:21` **You**

Will be thinking about you tonight\.  I could see the pain and frustration in your eyes today\.\. I am sooooo sorry I never realized they were so heavy\.\.   I feel like I added to them but no more of that\.\. we can support each other through this\.


**135.** `19:30` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**

It‚Äôs a heavy time‚Ä¶ phase that will pass‚Ä¶ they all do\. I‚Äôm very glad I have you though\. xo


**136.** `19:31` **You**

Same\. I am here for you just like you have been for me\.


**137.** `19:56` **You**

You know I was thinking in the drive over here you are just as emotionally expressive as I am\.\. but a lot of it you do through the words of others this songs you share\.  Maybe I am way off but most of the time when I listen to the words there is a pretty clear message there\.


**138.** `19:56` **You**

Remind me to play the sailor song next time we are together\.


**139.** `22:06` **You**

Hey I assume you have already gone to bed or are having a bad night or maybe both\.  I am just going to go to sleep\.  Nite\. Xo


**140.** `22:07` **You**

Hope you are ok\.


**141.** `20:00` **Meredith Lamb (+14169386001)**
