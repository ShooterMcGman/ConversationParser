### 31. msg_13115

**Meredith Lamb \(\+14169386001\)** - 2025-05-25T09:27:42

So just for your mental peace of mind, I asked Andrew this morning if we talked a lot while I was messed up on fri night\. He said we talked about Maelle when we got home from work and I was already drunk\. He said we talked a bit later but he doesn’t even remember about what \(and he wasn’t drinking\)\. So it was very inconsequential…\.


---

### 32. msg_13116

**You** - 2025-05-25T09:53:30

I am glad you can put that to bed\.   At least you don’t have to wonder and worry\.


---

### 33. msg_13117

**Meredith Lamb \(\+14169386001\)** - 2025-05-25T10:03:19

I mean I was 99% sure but I know you weren’t so thought I should ask\.


---

### 34. msg_13118

**You** - 2025-05-25T10:35:15

So I knew about the heart to heart with Andrew about maelle you mentioned that to me and explained  it\.  I knew maelle got home and you said something about the ring\. Then you said something about your mother thinking you were messed up\.  I told you a bunch of times to be careful, that people as
Messed up as you were then could make some really stupid decisions and not know it or remember it\.  When maelle got home you said “you need some of that” to me honestly I don’t think you actually thought you were talking to me at that point that was the last thing you said\.   So if Andrew suggests\. I nothing of consequence I guess you are good\.  I think as long as nothing he perceived as bad happened he should be fine\.


---

### 35. msg_13119

**Meredith Lamb \(\+14169386001\)** - 2025-05-25T10:40:38

I think he is used to me\. If I said anything he isn’t sharing\. Also, he is not acting weird\.


---

I just realized this was going to be really really horrible, as I wanted to respect your needs\.  I just don't want hurt\.\. these fucking emotions suck\.\. i wish they would turn off again, just for a little while ffs\.

### 290. msg_13374

**Meredith Lamb \(\+14169386001\)** - 2025-05-25T20:45:41

**You** - 2025-05-25T20:50:20

You know\.\. I like puzzles\.\. I always have\.\. there is a logic to solving them\.\. an order a structure\.\. one\.\. or many solutions\.  I have come at this situation we are in both from a logical perspective\.\. and from a pure brute force passion perspective\.  I don't have an answer\.\. I am distracted, I am distraught, and I don't think there is a fix for this, not one that works for both of us, and certainly not one that will work for the long absences we are facing over the next few months\.  So I think not talking about it all is probably a good solution\.\. because then you won't hate or resent me for being a fucking shitty downer all the time\.\. and I don't have to feel bad about pushing back on your good intentions\.  I know you care\.\. I know you love me, but I just think our constant triyng to fix it won't I tried for a few weeks to figure out some shit\.\. none of it really took hold\.\. and I think we are at different places in what we need\.\. so that is why I kind of am withdrawing\.\. you are ver\.\.\. \[truncated\]

### 293. msg_13377

**You** - 2025-05-25T20:52:16

Sometimes your honesty is "stark"\.\. don't get me wrong, I love it, and I love you\.  But sometimes when you drop some knowledge it lands with a thud\.\. lol if you get my meaning\.  Sometimes it lands on me with a thud\.  That was golf\.


---

### 294. msg_13378

**Meredith Lamb \(\+14169386001\)** - 2025-05-25T20:53:05

**You** - 2025-05-25T21:21:42

If I believe we were meant to connect\.\. perhaps we were meant to connect when we did\.\. so that us going through all this shit would just show us how important we are to each other\.\.\. I dunno\.

yeah that is where our situations are different\.  I tried to explain to her\.\. because she was being a bit harsh\.\. because she is hurt of course\.\. just because I made this choice doesn't mean I don't want her to be happy\.\. doesn't mean we won't stay in contact\.\. and doesn't mean I won't miss her\.  She said you will replace me with someone else fast enough, if not Meredith, then someone else\.  I explained again\.\. Mer and I were not planned, just happened\.\. I was fully ready to be alone\.\.

This is just a lot on both sides\. Yours and mine\. It is so much to process\. I appreciate hearing about how it went between you two because I’ve been worrying about when Andrew finds out so it helps me a bit\. But reading that you will miss her, while I know that is natural and totally ok, it still stings a little\. But I don’t blame you or think it isn’t normal… just a lot\. This situation is weird\.

Look\.\. I am not naive\.\. Andrew will be a part of my life going forward\.\. or at least I hope he is\.\. because I want to be apart of your life, and your kids\.  Just like I hope somehow you can become a part of my kids' lives\.

**You** - 2025-05-25T23:14:28

Okay, I've gone through your conversation with Meredith to identify and count the instances where you suggested connecting \(meeting, talking, etc\.\) and her response could be categorized as a rebuff \(a "no" to your immediate request, even if with a reason\) or non\-committal \(vague, deflecting, or an indefinite postponement\)\.
Here are the instances documented in chronological order:
Monday, April 14, 2025 \(\[snippet\_3\]\)
Your Suggestion: You asked if she was busy tomorrow and stated, "I want to see you\."
Meredith's Initial Response: "Depends," and then "You do? Why\."
Analysis: Her initial responses were probing and could be perceived as non\-committal or making you justify your desire before she eventually said, "I want to see you too\. No plans yet\." While this ultimately led to a positive indication for meeting, the initial replies were not a straightforward affirmation\.
Tuesday, April 15, 2025 \(\[snippet\_4\]\)
Your Suggestion: After she expressed it was hard not to see you, you offered, "I ca\.\.\. \[truncated\]

Yeah I feel like I need to, I feel you need it to\.  I think it makes it more real for both of us when someone else knows

### 966. msg_14074

Characterize him an old and trusted friend\.\. like a mentor or big brother


---

### 974. msg_14082

**Meredith Lamb \(\+14169386001\)** - 2025-05-27T09:20:29

Pros
1\. Emotional support and grounding perspective
A trusted colleague or mentor can offer wisdom, support, and a grounded outside view—especially helpful when you’re navigating the emotional complexity of your relationship and work dynamics\.
2\. Trusted sounding board
They may help you think through difficult decisions, like future disclosures, boundary\-setting, or how to protect your reputations\.
3\. Reduced sense of secrecy
If you’ve been carrying the relationship quietly, telling one trusted person can reduce the emotional burden of secrecy\.
4\. Safe test case
This can be a way to see how disclosure feels and gauge how someone outside the relationship reacts—before considering broader transparency, if ever\.
⸻
Cons
1\. Risk of unintentional spread
Even trusted colleagues can slip up or feel conflicted about keeping the information private, especially if they feel loyalty to others or organizational policies\.
2\. Change in perception
Even with good intentions, your mentor might view eith\.\.\. \[truncated\]

### 978. msg_14086

**Meredith Lamb \(\+14169386001\)** - 2025-05-27T09:35:50

I don’t really think anyone understands the depth of our relationship… even my family and friends seem to think it is this rebound fling


---

### 987. msg_14095

**Meredith Lamb \(\+14169386001\)** - 2025-05-27T09:36:05

Jaimie may think that and hence the “don’t see her anymore”


---

### 988. msg_14096

**Meredith Lamb \(\+14169386001\)** - 2025-05-27T09:36:21

If ppl understood things they wouldn’t bother suggesting that

### 989. msg_14097

---

### 993. msg_14101

**You** - 2025-05-27T09:38:51

Yeah I get it\.\. it won’t matter when she eventually finds out our lines of communication will pretty
Much be zero until or if she decides to get over it\.


---

### 994. msg_14102

**Meredith Lamb \(\+14169386001\)** - 2025-05-27T09:41:31

I’m sure she will move on to a new phase eventually but it may not be full acceptance but I think the anger will dull


---

### 995. msg_14103

**Meredith Lamb \(\+14169386001\)** - 2025-05-27T09:41:48

I stayed in the anger phase with Andrew for a good couple months

### 1005. msg_14113

**You** - 2025-05-27T09:48:12

I don’t think I am or you are\.\. again this happened it wasn’t planned and it is unique imho\.  It won’t mess with my head\.\. I want to be able to have my kids engage with you and your but it might just end up being maddie\.\.  not sure\.

**Meredith Lamb \(\+14169386001\)** - 2025-05-27T09:50:43

Just give it time\. I think we both see this being years so it is hard to predict how things will be years later…


---

### 1007. msg_14115

**You** - 2025-05-27T09:52:23

Meaning we see this lasting years\.\. yeah I don’t think about that because I don’t want to think about a potential end\.

Yeah honestly the more I see you and spend time with you the more I love you doesn’t make sense but it is true\.  It is easier mentally but I do miss you and that will be hard until this is over\.

With Andrew showing up, it got me thinking about you wondering if I would do anything with him when I was all messed up and/or drunk… it’s a big no, but I get the concern\. You know, we have never had a sexual relationship like you and I\. It has always been very different and hence not very fun most of the years/time\. Like even the beginning I remember when I was pregnant with Mac\. He had many expectations and made certain things feel very obligatory\. I don’t feel anything like that with you so our experience together is different\. I would never choose to go back, messed up, drunk or not\. FYI\.

**You** - 2025-05-30T17:31:59

Great question\. While Ticket to Ride iOS is a faithful adaptation of the board game, there are a few key differences—some subtle, some impactful—between the digital version and the physical tabletop version\.
⸻
🎯 Core Gameplay – Same
•	Rules, objectives, and mechanics are identical to the board game\.
•	Train routes, destination tickets, scoring system, and gameplay flow are all preserved\.
⸻
🔁 What’s Different
1\. Setup & Scoring
•	✅ iOS: Setup is instant, and scoring is automated \(including longest route detection and completed tickets\)\.
•	🧩 Board Game: Manual setup takes time, and scoring is done by hand \(can be error\-prone\)\.
2\. Game Speed
•	✅ iOS: Much faster turns, especially in solo play\. No shuffling, counting, or disputes\.
•	🧩 Board Game: Slower pace, especially with new players or when double\-checking rules\.
3\. Rule Enforcement
•	✅ iOS: Strict rules are enforced by the app; no accidental cheating or missed rules\.
•	🧩 Board Game: Players can make mistakes in rules or scoring \(espec\.\.\. \[truncated\]

The iOS version of Ticket to Ride has generally been well\-received, praised for its faithful adaptation of the board game and its convenience\. However, it has also faced criticism, particularly following a significant overhaul\. Here’s an overview of its reception:
⸻
✅ Strengths
•	Faithful Adaptation: The app closely mirrors the physical board game, maintaining its core mechanics and strategic depth\.
•	User\-Friendly Interface: The digital format streamlines gameplay with automated scoring, tutorials, and intuitive controls, making it accessible to both new and seasoned players\.
•	Multiplayer Options: Offers various modes including solo play against AI, online multiplayer, and pass\-and\-play, catering to different playstyles\.
⸻
⚠️ Criticisms
•	Transition to New App: The shift from the original app to a new version developed by Marmalade Game Studio led to user dissatisfaction\. Players were required to repurchase the game and its expansions, and previous progress or purchases did not carry\.\.\. \[truncated\]

I don't see these feelings changing\.\. but I would never oblige you to do anything\.\. like there aren't quota's or required things you must do to or for me lol\.\. that is fucking nonsense\.

I told him basically I’ve had 3 prior longer term relationships but only one where maybe some emotional component was involved but honestly it became unstable and always felt a little shifty and what I have with you feels unbreakable


---

### 2367. msg_15475

**Meredith Lamb \(\+14169386001\)** - 2025-05-30T22:39:12

But basically it was because too many drugs were involved \(in retrospect\)


---

### 2368. msg_15476

**You** - 2025-05-30T22:40:56

Yeah that is unfortunate\.\. like I want to be honest\.\. it isn't that I haven't had long term relationships where there weren't emotions\.\. I had very emotional relationships\. with a couple of people\.\. again\.\. nothing like this\.\. nothing even close\.\. but I would say much stronger than what i had with Jaimie nonetheless\.\.

**You** - 2025-05-30T23:18:47

That's a beautiful place to be — when two people feel deeply connected, trust each other, and are open to exploration\. The phrase \*“there is so much more than intercourse”\* speaks to a broader, richer experience of intimacy that goes beyond just penetration\. It sounds like your partner is expressing a desire to deepen your sensual connection and explore the full spectrum of pleasure, which can actually heighten the experience of sex as a whole\.
Here’s how to think about this:
\#\#\# 1\. \*\*Emotional and Erotic Intimacy\*\*
When partners feel safe and deeply connected, the possibilities for exploration multiply\. Intimacy can involve:
\* Prolonged eye contact
\* Emotional vulnerability
\* Non\-verbal communication
\* Playfulness and shared fantasies
This emotional groundwork can make physical intimacy feel more profound and satisfying\.
\#\#\# 2\. \*\*Sensual Touch and Body Worship\*\*
Exploring each other's bodies without a goal of climax or penetration can lead to incredible discoveries\. Try:
\* Sensate foc\.\.\. \[truncated\]

### 2727. msg_15835

**You** - 2025-05-31T00:59:08

Initially you references 2 relationships\. I knew who they were\. easy guess for me based on what you have shared\.\. I did suggest earlier\.\. that if these were the drug related relationships I might not be able to replicate the experiences\. Now you talked about how those relationships were much more open than that between you and Andrew\.\. and I can see why who likes to be told how to service their partner all the time\.  Certainly wouldn't make me want to be super open for fun and stuff\.  So you made the reference to the 2 previous relationships\.\. then to this couples board\.\. game\.\. gpt suggested games like \-  Monogamy
Our Moments \(for couples\)
The Discovery Game
Talk Flirt Dare
Let's Talk About Sex \(conversation card decks\)

She said some people when they get in our situations\.\. tend to look backwards at what they had and yearn for it\.\. for the excitement, the adventure, the freedom\.  They want to feel that again\.\. sometimes that means going back to the people that they used to be with to experience that\.\. sometimes that means something else\.\. she just said be careful if that is what she wants, and you don't fit that mold for her\.

Well I did not
Get up to a happy morning I was up till 2:30 am Gracie decided
To have another go j got involved another fight\.  I think I am going to spend a bit knife and rent a three bedroom townhouse\.\. Gracie seems to think unless I have three bedrooms it will be impossible for her to visit\.  So I will need to do some math\.\. the rent
Will be about half my take home\.\. so should be interesting\.\. with all the other expenses\.\. will basically be a year where I cannot save much except my bonus and ltip\.  After that I am doing what we talked about last night\.\. assuming you remember the very very interesting conversation we had

I don’t think I fully read this last night but it is sort of what I was thinking\. I just was worried that if whatever is happening between us physically doesn’t last or stops for some reason, you’re not going to hole yourself up in the basement and shut me out\. Like there is other ways to connect and be intimate\. Really all I was trying to articulate in a really horrible manner LOL
