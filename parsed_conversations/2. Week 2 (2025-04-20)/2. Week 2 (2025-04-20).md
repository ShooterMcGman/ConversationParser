You always impressed me at work \- you are really highly regarded\.\. your talent was anticipation\.\. you would look beyond the request to figure out what the person asking the question didn't even know they wanted and then give it to them on a silver platter\.

Can you tell me about saposexuality? Is it more common with people in their middle years?
Show thinking
Okay, let's break down sapiosexuality based on your preferences\.
Core Concepts: Sapiosexuality
Definition: Sapiosexuality describes a type of attraction where a person finds high levels of intelligence \(the "mind"\) to be the most sexually attractive feature in another person\.
Primary Driver: For someone identifying as sapiosexual, intelligence isn't just a desirable trait; it's the primary trigger for sexual or romantic attraction, often outweighing physical appearance, social status, or other common factors\.
Mechanism: The attraction often stems from the quality of conversation, intellectual depth, wit, curiosity, and how someone thinks and expresses their thoughts\.
Addressing Your Specific Question: Prevalence in Middle Years
Lack of Evidence: There is no significant scientific data or reliable research to indicate that sapiosexuality is inherently more common among people in their\.\.\. \[truncated\]

### 189. msg_2570

**You** - 2025-04-20T04:23:35

Now I asked the middle years question \- because I kind of had the same logical conclusion as Gemini did \- as you get older you tend to evolve and appreciate a more nuanced relationship\.\. not just purely physical\.\. I kinda was never about that anyways\.


---

### 190. msg_2571

This is the least attractive side of my intelligence\.\. it is the worst part of it\.\. what it does to me\.  I am afraid to say yes because my brain tells me if I do so \-she will be turned off, she will think this is too much trouble, she will suggest slowing down perhaps a lot, etc etc etc\.  Do you see what I mean\.\. stupid brain\.

### 928. msg_3309

anyhow the expressiveness can be chalked up to my writing \- it is my trade \- so I do tend to be a little descriptive / articulate\.  But the rest the opening up\.\. was unexpected\.\. I think I wanted to prove to you how much you meant to me\.\. and felt like I need to take the jump first\.

Just because he never let me even say my ex’s name and was very dramatic about it all\. He goes “I don’t think I was dramatic”\. lol I said, ok extreme then\. Then: “I thought you said you weren’t going to date anyone?”

Oh the Andrew thing did get into my head the other night\.  I don’t know if j is still bouncing around in yours that way but, hard to think about that\.\.  I can let
You know that I feel like as of Sat morning there will
W no suggestions of any kind of reconciliation, no more overtures or invitations or requests
Of any kind\.  So if that helps your head, you have nothing to worry about there whatsoever\.  I think we’re our situations reversed you might have a tough time thinking about j and I at the cottage is all\.  lol man\. This is like no situation ever is it\.  It is like you are getting together with someone who is literally living with their ex who is trying to get back together with them on both sides of the fence\.\. insane tricks on the mind\.  Just cannot wait for tomorrow then Thursday then Detroit then Chatham then everything else\.  Luv you have a good day\.

### 1191. msg_3572

**Meredith Lamb \(\+14169386001\)** - 2025-04-21T07:47:33

It’s definitely a fucked up situation\. Anytime there is silence from you I’m also wondering if you both are having some sort of productive conversation where things shift\. Or your girls say something that impacts a shift in your head\. If you and j were at the cottage together… yeah I guess that would mess with my head a bit potentially\. The reality is that this place is just a second home and there are just as many bad memories here as at home \(we lived here during Covid so…\) so my reality is that this isn’t entirely a lovely vacation home and more a second home with all the work and drudgery that comes with our other place in Toronto\.
For the record, j absolutely bounces around in my head\. I saw you two together at work when we sat near each other and she would go to your desk\. So i kind of saw how you guys interacted at that time at work at least\. So I can easily get visions in my head bc of that\. I do compartmentalize it away though so I don’t go crazy with everything else going on\.\.\.\. \[truncated\]

**Meredith Lamb \(\+14169386001\)** - 2025-04-22T17:47:59

Sigh, fine\.
Here’s what he said:
“ROFL no action for anyone else\. I am saving myself\.”
“It’s true more than you know lol\. Will let you think on that one\.”
At face value, yes — it sounds like he may be implying that he hasn’t had physical intimacy with his wife in a long time\. But there are other possible interpretations, and all of them are meaningful in different ways:
⸻
1\. He could be saying: “I’m emotionally and physically committed to you now — even if we aren’t official\.”
The “saving myself” line might not just be about past abstinence — it could be his way of telling you:
“Even though I’m not free yet, my body and heart are already yours\. No one else exists in that space anymore\.”
That’s not just romantic — it’s a quiet declaration of loyalty\.
⸻
2\. He could be trying to subtly express how serious this is for him\.
This might have been his way of saying:
“I’m not taking this lightly\. You’re not a fling\. I’m protecting what we have\.”
The joking tone \(“ROFL”\) softens it — but the tru\.\.\. \[truncated\]

I wouldn't put it that way\.  I am downstairs working on the separation documents\.\. going to gym around 8:30\.  Gracie had a meltdown today which is why I had to leave meeting \- I was talking to financial advisor on one break that didn't go well \- and Jaimie went back a bit on going back to Moncton suggesting she only will if Gracie and Maddie come \- which won't be at min for a year\.\.  and max longer\.\. I told her if it is longer then we will need to sell the house and figure something else out\.\. in meantime I am just going to rent a 1 bedroom, it makes no sense for maddie to stay with me in this situation\.  Which is also kind of depressing\.

### 1998. msg_4379

**Meredith Lamb \(\+14169386001\)** - 2025-04-23T23:00:33

Key Elements of Your Situation:
•	Common\-law relationship: 15 years
•	3 children
•	Your income: $150K
•	His income: $550K
•	You receive full child support
•	Equal asset division
•	$150K one\-time spousal support payment
⸻
What This Means in Context:
1\. Child Support Already Helps Offset Income Disparity
If you’re receiving full Table child support \(i\.e\., based on his $550K income and you having primary or majority parenting time\), that could be $2,000–$3,000\+ per month—a meaningful monthly contribution\.
However, child support is for the children, not for your personal needs or long\-term support\. Courts don’t consider child support a substitute for spousal support, though it may reduce the amount or duration of spousal support in some cases\.
⸻
2\. Equal Asset Division
Equal asset division means there’s no property\-based compensation for career sacrifices, homemaking, or lost income opportunity\. So, unless the asset division is tilted heavily in your favour \(which it’s not here\), that also\.\.\. \[truncated\]

**Meredith Lamb \(\+14169386001\)** - 2025-04-24T07:08:14

Great question\.
The 10\-year spousal support duration I used earlier is based on a common interpretation of the Spousal Support Advisory Guidelines \(SSAGs\) and your situation—but I’ll walk you through exactly why that figure is reasonable, and when it might be shorter, longer, or even indefinite\.
⸻
SSAG Duration Guidelines for Spousal Support
For long relationships like yours \(15 years\), there are three duration pathways under the SSAGs:
⸻
1\. Rule of 20
If the relationship lasted 20 years or more → Indefinite support
Does not apply here—your relationship was 15 years\.
⸻
2\. Rule of 65
If length of relationship \+ recipient’s age at separation = 65 or more
→ Indefinite support
You didn’t mention your age\. If you’re, say, 50 or older, this might apply\. For example:
•	50 years old \+ 15 years = 65 → You could qualify for indefinite support under Rule of 65\.
⸻
3\. Without Rule of 20 or 65: Use the Standard Duration Range
For relationships under 20 years, but not short\-term, the SSAGs suggest:
0\.\.\. \[truncated\]

Lying here thinking about I might have a little ocd thinking about the taste of your skin\. Lol asked ChatGPT:
When you’ve never experienced that level of sensory connection before, it usually means a few powerful things are happening at once:
•	Emotional safety: Your body feels safe enough with him to let go and fully experience him\. That deep comfort allows your senses to open up more than they would with someone you only partly trust\.
•	Attachment and chemistry: Your body is recognizing him as a “match” on a primal level — beyond just logical attraction\. His natural scent, his taste, even the feel of his skin, all register as intoxicating because they align with your body’s unconscious preferences for bonding\.
•	Emotional intensification through scarcity: You had to wait for this — to hold back, to anticipate, to imagine\. That makes the real thing even more intense when it finally happens\. Your brain has basically been starving for him, and now it’s drinking in every detail\.
•	Rare e\.\.\. \[truncated\]
