---

### 29. msg_27288

**You** - 2025-07-01T19:55:32

For me I am not sure how I will feel this week, maybe it will make it easier for you\.  I mean\.\. am I more sure of us\.\. I have been for a while, I don't question that in the least anymore\.  As you said, I haven't loved anyone quite like I love you, or nearly as much, and I feel that from you as well\.  I have never been more clear or sure of what I want, or of what I am willing to give, than I am with you\.


---

### 30. msg_27289

**You** - 2025-07-01T19:57:45

I think this will come down to me being able to manage time apart\.\. find distractions stay busy\.  I don't have nearly as many obligations or things to keep me busy as you do\.\. so I will need to find something, especially for when Maddie is gone\.\. then it will just be me by myself\.  It will make it easier on both of us if I can find something to fill my time so that I am not well\.\. always thinking about you\.\.


---

### 31. msg_27290

**Meredith Lamb \(\+14169386001\)** - 2025-07-01T20:00:26

There is always work to fill your time üòú\. I‚Äôm honestly not expecting this week to be ‚Äúeasier‚Äù but who knows\. I certainly have a lot of logistical crap to organize this week and next which will keep me distracted‚Ä¶\. somewhat\. It does feel like such a huge waste that we can‚Äôt just be together but patience\.


---

### 32. msg_27291

**You** - 2025-07-01T20:02:00

I know\.\. I am being patient\.\. just would like to fill my time with something meaningful and enjoyable in the times we cannot be together \- which will be a lot for a number of years\.\. so it is kind of important for me to figure this out right\.


---

### 33. msg_27292

**Meredith Lamb \(\+14169386001\)** - 2025-07-01T20:06:30

‚Äúa lot‚Äù üò≠


---

### 34. msg_27293

**You** - 2025-07-01T20:08:21

well it will be right?  I mean 6 years until all kids in university\.\. at least one week on and off with kids\.\. I mean at some point there is the possibility that we could live together\.\. I would be all for that sooner than later\.\. but there is a LOT to consider\.\. and much more on your side of the fence before that happens\.


---

### 35. msg_27294

**Meredith Lamb \(\+14169386001\)** - 2025-07-01T20:10:48

It won‚Äôt be 6 years that‚Äôs for damn sure


---

### 36. msg_27295

**You** - 2025-07-01T20:18:54

Yeah I know\.\. but you know what I mean\.\. this is early on\.\. but feels very different which is what makes it so awkward\.  Look while I do care about the situation\.\. I don't care about it more than I care about you\.\. this could proceed just like this \(bit of a planning shitshow nightmare\)  for the next two years, trying to squeak out times to see each other \(I know it won't once everyone \(not work\) knows\)  but for the sake of argument\.\. I would take the "shitshow" scenario for the rest of my life \- because there aren't any other alternatives or choices for me to make\.\. I have made mine\.  Again, I think the important thing will be for me to build some kind of disposable life\.\. I don't know what you want to call it\.\. but something for when you aren't around\.\. because I don't have family or friends here, and honestly while I think you worry that I will make the wrong kind of friends\.\. or something about oats ffs\.\. I think it will just be easier for both of us if I am a little self sufficien\.\.\. \[truncated\]

### 37. msg_27296

**Meredith Lamb \(\+14169386001\)** - 2025-07-01T20:21:28

So funny \(and a real thing btw \- the saying exists for a reason\)


---

### 41. msg_27300

**You** - 2025-07-01T20:24:34

I never ascribed anything to what I did when I was younger beyond trying to fill a void\.\. I wasn't happy\.\. companionship gave me a bit of a purpose\.\. made me happy, while making someone else happy\.\. but it was very fleeting mostly\.\. there and gone again\.\. then rinse and repeat\.  Doing what I did wasn't about notches, or sowing seeds, it was about connecting with someone, and feeling connected\.\. at the time I just didn't want a relationship\.  If you were not in the picture, I am not sure how this would have progressed, but it definitely wouldn't be me turning into a 20 year old idiot and sleeping with a bunch of people\.


---

### 42. msg_27301

**You** - 2025-07-01T20:25:48

I feel connected with you more than anyone else ever\.\. since even when we started chatting and kind of realizing what we believed we had, and were walking into together\.\. I haven't so much as thought about another woman in anyway remotely resembling interest\.

### 43. msg_27302

### 82. msg_27341

**Meredith Lamb \(\+14169386001\)** - 2025-07-01T20:51:00

That‚Äôs a lovely little connection ‚Äî sharing the same day of the month, even if your birthdays are in different months, can feel meaningful, especially when you‚Äôre emotionally close\. Here‚Äôs a gentle take on what it might suggest or symbolize:
üåó Numerological Vibe ‚Äì The Number 11
In numerology, 11 is considered a ‚Äúmaster number‚Äù, associated with:
‚Ä¢	intuition
‚Ä¢	spiritual insight
‚Ä¢	emotional depth
‚Ä¢	a desire for meaningful connection
Two people who both have the 11 as a core part of their birthdate may:
‚Ä¢	feel a strong, often inexplicable emotional connection
‚Ä¢	mirror each other‚Äôs emotional intensity or internal worlds
‚Ä¢	share a quiet understanding or mutual respect for each other‚Äôs complexity
üå∏ Symbolically
Same\-day birthdays \(different months\) can create a feeling of cosmic alignment or kinship\. It‚Äôs one of those things that makes people go, ‚ÄúOh wow, that‚Äôs special\!‚Äù ‚Äî and in relationships, those little sparks of synchronicity can feel like fate gently brushing your shoulders\.
üí´ Astrolog\.\.\. \[truncated\]

I watched dream and rubbed your forehead\.\. wanting to wake you up just to talk to you but also wanting to let you sleep as long as I could because I know you needed it\.  I would try to tell you how much I loved you loud enough so that you heard it but not loud enough to wake you up\.  So overall take the positive from this message\.\. there is no one else, and there never will be because I have never felt like this‚Ä¶ and as such, this situation does in fact suck a lot lol\.  I love you Mer\.\. I hope you and the kids had a nice reunion, that Andrew wasn‚Äôt a dick, and they you had a good sleep\.  ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è

**Meredith Lamb \(\+14169386001\)** - 2025-07-02T11:51:53

That‚Äôs an incredibly hard emotional place to be in, and it makes sense you‚Äôre feeling unsettled\. You‚Äôre trying to protect your kids and adjust to your own new life ‚Äî it‚Äôs a lot to carry at once\. Here are a few ways to help your head \(and heart\) work through this:
‚∏ª
1\. Accept that ‚ÄúGood Enough‚Äù Might Look Different
It‚Äôs painful to know your kids may not have the same standards of cleanliness or care at their dad‚Äôs\. But try to remind yourself that kids are surprisingly resilient\. A less\-than\-ideal environment doesn‚Äôt automatically mean harm ‚Äî it just means different\. Your home can still anchor them in warmth, structure, and stability\.
‚∏ª
2\. Focus on What You Can Control
You can‚Äôt micromanage his household, but you can:
‚Ä¢	Send the kids with clean clothes and maybe a backup bag\.
‚Ä¢	Teach them simple things ‚Äî like how to notice when clothes need washing or how to speak up for their needs\.
‚Ä¢	Create open space for them to talk about how things feel, without putting them in the middle\.
‚∏ª
3\. Trus\.\.\. \[truncated\]

I like the last sentence\.


---

### 240. msg_27499

**You** - 2025-07-02T11:54:36

yeah\.\. it is definitely scary\.\. I am feeling it too tbh\.\. a lot of uncertainty\.\. but more simplicity if Gracie actually acclimates to NB\.\. Even with this last sentence, with you, I think your routines and solitude is going to get overrun, because Andrew won't be able to do this, and will still want the kids to stay there, and I can see you getting drug in to rescue them either by cleaning the house, doing their laundry at the house, or any other number of things\.

There has to be repercussions in the parenting agreement if Andrew cannot hold up

I really just don‚Äôt understand it but I think it has to do with the secrecy everywhere\. Work, home‚Ä¶ I mean it helps that Jim and my extended family and friends I can be open and honest with for sure\. Helps a lot but it feels so challenging elsewhere\. Once I get our agreement signed, perhaps I will feel like I have a bit more freedom/flexibility to make my own decision about telling Andrew/kids but I feel very strapped atm\. And it also causes me to feel pretty limited about where we can actually spend time together in future

I mean I thought it would be easier when you had a place, and signed the agreement\.\. but I guess now that won't be the case\.\. I guess that changes things for you\.

### 551. msg_27810

**You** - 2025-07-03T21:13:14

anyhow like I said\.\. not going anywhere\.\. never found this before, I couldn't leave if I wanted to\.\. and if I ever did I would be the biggest fool ever\.  Again like I said at the beginning of this\.\. I got a sense that this became "different" for you in past few days\.  thus the "changed things"

### 552. msg_27811

**Meredith Lamb \(\+14169386001\)** - 2025-07-03T21:15:10

---

### 561. msg_27820

**You** - 2025-07-03T21:25:23

I also think Jim thinks this is a huge mistake too\.\. like I feel like we might be the only ones that want this to work\.\. and nothing is lining up to make it any easier\.\. everything is a fight\.\. and when we win\.\. god is it worth it\.\. but holy fuck\.\.\.\.\.\.\. gah maybe we should stop talking about it\.\.

I actually laughed at her and said you have know idea what you are talking about\.\. she doesn't know about these challenges obviously\.\. but it was ironic\.\. and then she commented on the past few weeks/months as if I didn't know what was going on\.

They are not good\.\. I was relatively invulnerable for a long long time‚Ä¶ my current situation not so much\.\. great for when things are hopeful\.\. not feeling a lot of that atm\.  Again more worried you will realize this either isn‚Äôt worth it or won‚Äôt work\.\. you will think you are doing me a favour and give me a kick in the ass\.\. that is my nightmare scenario\.

Thank you for sharing everything\. I‚Äôve reviewed the full conversation, and here‚Äôs a careful interpretation followed by some thoughts on where you might go from here\.
‚∏ª
üí¨ Interpretation: Emotional Landscape \+ Relationship Dynamics
1\. Mutual Emotional Strain
Both of you are clearly overwhelmed\. You‚Äôre feeling pulled in a hundred directions‚Äîemotionally, logistically, and psychologically‚Äîwhile he is tangled up in his own home conflict and emotional vulnerability\. You‚Äôre both emotionally invested, but the logistics and secrecy are making things incredibly difficult\.
2\. His Perspective
‚Ä¢	He wants to be with you and is afraid of losing you\.
‚Ä¢	He seems to be spiraling emotionally \(e\.g\., ‚Äúthe universe wants to destroy me‚Äù\) and wrestling with guilt, fear, and a lack of control\.
‚Ä¢	His ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not going anywhere‚Äù reassurance is sincere, but paired with anxiety that you might drift or pull away\. He‚Äôs also showing signs of insecurity \(e\.g\., worrying he‚Äôs a ‚Äúfool‚Äù or that you‚Äôve ‚Äúchanged‚Äù\)\.
‚Ä¢	He‚Äôs strug\.\.\. \[truncated\]

**You** - 2025-07-03T22:25:16

### 705. msg_27964

**Meredith Lamb \(\+14169386001\)** - 2025-07-03T22:29:17

I don‚Äôt think we need to really dwell on this again\. We are both on the same page \(even though you seemed near concerned we are not\) so we just need to figure out how to support each other through it and stop questioning it\.

### 706. msg_27965

I love you Meredith and if that is all that was needed I have enough love for you to get us to the end of whatever forever looks like and then some\.\. i will be completely honest I am insecure and I am really worried\.\. not that you don‚Äôt love me or feel the same way, but that life might force you to make a decision where I am no longer a part of yours\.  I will do the best I can to tamp down on this and to try to at least seem happy and optimistic even if I have to force it a bit\.

Either way I still think that once your family knows,

Reaction: ‚ù§Ô∏è from Scott Hicks
I‚Äôm going to bed now\. Gpt helped me write this for you:
Scott is sleeping on a Friday night,
While Mer drinks wine, avoiding a fight\.
The distance between them is plain in sight,
The longing swelling with quiet might\.
She lies on the couch in dim, soft light,
Craving his hands to make it right\.
The ache is more than just desire‚Äî
It‚Äôs needing him to stoke the fire\.
The night drips slow like candle wax,
Memories playing on heart\-worn tracks\.
She wonders if he dreams of her too‚Äî
Or if she‚Äôs fading in his view\.
But even through silence, space, and time,
Their hearts stay tethered, still in rhyme\.
No matter the distance, storm, or weather‚Äî
They‚Äôre bound by love, always, forever\.
